Having regard to the proposal from the Commission;
Whereas the operation and development of the common market in agricultural products must be accompanied by the establishment of a common agricultural policy to include in particular a common organization of agricultural markets, which may take various forms depending on the product;

When a substantial price rise is recorded on the Community market and this situation is likely to continue, thereby disturbing or threatening to disturb the market, the necessary measures may be taken.
1. Sluice-gate prices shall be fixed in advance for each quarter in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 17.
The price for the quantity of feed grain on the world market shall be determined quarterly on the basis of the prices for such grain for the six months preceding the quarter during which the sluice-gate price is fixed.

Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (1),
Whereas most Member States have hitherto endeavoured, as part of their national breeding policies, to promote the production of livestock of a limited number of breeds meeting specific zootechnic standards ; whereas the breeds and standards vary from one Member State to another ; whereas these disparities hinder intra-Community trade;
Whereas implementing measures in certain technical areas should be taken ; whereas, for the adoption of such measures, a procedure should be provided for establishing close cooperation between Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on Zootechnics ; whereas, until the adoption of those implementing measures, the provisions which are at present in force in the areas in question must remain unchanged;

Until the entry into force of such provisions, approval of pure-bred breeding animals of the bovine species for breeding and approval of bulls to be used for artificial insemination as well as the use of semen and embryos shall remain subject to national law, on the understanding that that law may not be more restrictive than that applicable to pure-bred breeding animals of the bovine species, semen and embryos in the Member State of destination.

Until the implementation of Community rules on the subject, the conditions applicable to imports of pure-bred breeding animals of the bovine species from non-member countries must not be more favourable than those governing intra-Community trade.
1. Where the procedure laid down in this Article is to be used, matters shall without delay be referred by the Chairman, either on his own initiative or at the request of a Member State, to the Standing Committee on Zootechnics (hereinafter referred to as "the Committee") set up by the Council Decision 77/505/EEC.
4. The Commission shall adopt the measures and shall apply them immediately where they are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee. Where they are not in accordance with the opinion of the Committee or if no opinion is delivered, the Commission shall without delay propose to the Council the measures to be adopted.

Whereas, since procedures for the award of public contracts are of such short duration, competent review bodies must, among other things, be authorized to take interim measures aimed at suspending such a procedure or the implementation of any decisions which may be taken by the contracting authority; whereas the short duration of the procedures means that the aforementioned infringements need to be dealt with urgently;

1. The Commission may invoke the procedure for which this Article provides when, prior to a contract being concluded, it considers that a clear and manifest infringement of Community provisions in the field of public procurement has been committed during a contract award procedure falling within the scope of Directives 71/305/EEC and 77/62/EEC.

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2),
Whereas this system can only achieve the desired result if the industry recognizes that it is justified;
Whereas compliance with measures for the conservation and management of fishery resources requires an increased sense of responsibility on the part of all operators in the fishing industry;
Whereas it is vital that Member States cooperate at the operational level during inspections at sea of fishing activities, in order to permit effective and financially justifiable inspections, particularly of operations carried out in waters outside the jurisdiction or sovereignty of a Member State;
Whereas the management of fisheries by the fixing of TACs requires detailed knowledge of the composition of catches, such knowledge being equally necessary for the other procedures provided for in Regulation (EEC) No 3760/92; whereas this requires the keeping of a logbook by each master of a fishing vessel;
Whereas, in order to provide exemptions from the obligation to keep a logbook or complete a landing declaration by small fishing vessels for which such an obligation would constitute a disproportionate burden in relation to their fishing capacity, it is necessary for each Member State to monitor the activities of such vessels by the implementation of a sampling plan;
Whereas, in order to ensure the conservation and management of all the resources used, the provisions relating to the logbook, the landing and sales declarations and the information concerning transshipments and registration of catches may be extended to stocks which are not subject to a TAC or quota;
Whereas compliance with the provisions relating to the use of fishing gear cannot be adequately ensured where nets of different mesh sizes are carried on board, unless they are subject to additional control measures; whereas for specific fisheries it may be appropriate to establish specific rules such as the one-net rule;
Whereas, in cases where this Regulation has not been respected by those responsible for fishing vessels should be made subject to additional control measures for conservation purposes;
Whereas it is necessary to establish general rules to allow Community inspectors appointed by the Commission to ensure the uniform application of Community rules and to verify the control carried out by the competent authorities of Member States;
Whereas the possibility for the flag Member State to ensure that the rules of the conservation and management of fishery resources are observed is reduced in cases where the Member State of landing does not effectively prosecute irregularities; whereas provision must therefore be made to count catches made illegally against the quota of the Member State of landing if that State has not brought effective proceedings;
Whereas the confidentiality of the data collected in the framework of this Regulation should be guaranteed;
Whereas it is necessary to provide a transitional period for the implementation of specific provisions contained in certain Articles in order to allow the competent authorities of the Member States to establish and adapt their procedures to the requirements of the new Regulation;
- conservation and resource management measures,
as well as certain provisions relating to the effectiveness of sanctions to be applied in cases where the above-mentioned measures are not observed.
1. In order to ensure compliance with all the rules in force concerning conservation and control measures, each Member State shall, within its territory and within maritime waters subject to its sovereignty or jurisdiction, monitor fishing activity and related activities. It shall inspect fishing vessels and investigate all activities thus enabling verification of the implementation of this Regulation, including the activities of landing, selling, transporting and storing fish and recording landings and sales.
3. Each Member State shall monitor, outside the Community fishery zone, the activities of its vessels in cases where such control is required to ensure compliance with Community rules applicable in those waters.
1. In order to improve the effectiveness of surveillance of fishing activities, the Council shall decide before 1 January 1996, according to the procedure laid down in Article 43 of the Treaty, if and to what extend and when a continuous position monitoring system, either land- or satellite-based and using satellite communications for data transmission, shall be installed for Community fishing vessels.
3. When carrying out the pilot projects mentioned in paragraph 2, the Member State whose flag a vessel is flying or in which a vessel is registered shall take the necessary measures to ensure that the data transmitted by or recovered from, its fishing vessels are recorded in computer-readable form, regardless of the waters in which they are operating or the port they are in.
In carrying out the tasks entrusted to them, Member Sates shall ensure that the provisions and measures referred to in Article 2 are complied with. Moreover, they shall act in such a way as to avoid undue interference with normal fishing activities. They shall also ensure that there is no discrimination as regards the sectdor and vessels chosen for inspection.
In accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 36, detailed rules may be adopted for the implementation of Articles 2, 3 and 4, concerning in particular:
(c) the procedure to be used by inspectors, having boarded a fishing vessel, in inspecting that vessel, its gear or its catches;
(f) the certification of the characteristics of fishing vessels related to fishing activities;
Article 6
3. The masters of Community fishing vessels shall enter in their logbook the quantities caught at sea, the date and location of these catches and the species referred to in paragraph 2. The quantities discarded at sea may be recorded for evaluation purposes.
6. Each Member State shall carry out, on the basis of sampling, monitoring of the activities of fishing vessels which are exempt from the requirements specified by paragraphs 4 and 5 in order to ensure respect by these vessels of the Community rules in force.
8. Detailed rules for the implementation of this Article shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 36, including a geographical basis other than the ICES statistical rectangle, in certain specific cases.
- the landing location(s) and estimated time of arrival there,
3. The Commission, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 36, may grant an exemption for certain categories of Community fishing vessels from the obligation stipulated in paragraph 1 for a limited and renewable period, or make provision for another notification period taking into account inter alia, the distance between the fishing grounds, the landing locations and the ports where the vessels in question are registered or listed.
2. The Council may decide, acting by a qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, to extend the obligation set out in paragraph 1 to vessels having on overall length of less than 10 metres. The Council may also decide, acting by a qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, exemptions from the obligation set out in paragraph 1 for certain categories of vessels having an overall length equal to, or more than, 10 metres and pursuing specific fishing activities.
4. Detailed rules for implementation of this Article shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 36.
2. Should the first marketing of fishery products landed in a Member State be carried out in a manner different from that laid down in paragraph 1, the fishery products landed shall not be removed by the buyer until a sales not has been submitted to the competent authorities or other authorized bodies of the Member State in whose territory this operation has been carried out. The buyer shall be responsible for the accuracy of the data indicated in paragraph 3 which is contained in the sales note.

(b) the document mentioned in paragraph 1 is replaced by a copy of document T 2 M indicating the origin of the quantities transported.
7. Member States shall coordinate their control activities in order to ensure that inspection is as effective and economical as possible. To this end, Member States shall particularly exercise surveillance over the movement of merchandise which may have been drawn to their attention as possibly being the subject of operations contrary to Community Regulations.
2. Where landings of catches are not placed on the market for the first time by sale at auction, as provided for in Article 9 (2), Member States shall ensure that the quantities involved are notified to the auction centres or other bodies authorised by Member States.
Article 15

>TABLE>
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (2),
Whereas the International Safety Management Code providing for the safe operation of ships and for pollution prevention, hereinafter referred to as the 'ISM Code', was adopted by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) through Assembly Resolution A.741(18) of 4 November 1993 in the presence of the Member States and, through its incorporation into the International Convention on the Safety of Life at Sea 1974, will apply to ro-ro passenger vessels from 1 July 1998;
Whereas the Community's most urgent concern is for the safety management of ro-ro passenger ferries; whereas a uniform and coherent implementation of the ISM Code in all Member States can constitute a step towards the safety management of ro-ro passenger ferries;
Whereas action at Community level is the best way to ensure advance mandatory enforcement of the provisions of the ISM Code and effective control of its application, while avoiding distortion of competition between different Community ports and ro-ro ferries; whereas only a regulation, which is of direct applicability, can ensure such enforcement; whereas advance implementation requires that the Regulation be applicable as from 1 July 1996;
Whereas companies operating ro-ro ferries exclusively in sheltered waters between ports in the same Member State constitute a more limited risk and will need to assume a proportionately greater administrative work-load than other companies, and should therefore enjoy a temporary derogation;
Whereas a Member State must have the possibility of suspending the operation of certain ro-ro ferries from its ports where it considers that there is a risk of serious danger to safety of life or property or the environment, subject to a decision to be taken in the framework of a regulatory committee, to which the Member States must conform;
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
- the establishment and proper maintenance of shipboard and shore-based safety management systems by companies, and
For the purpose of this Regulation and with a view to the implementation of the ISM Code:
1. according to a published timetable; or
(d) 'recognized organization' means a body recognized in compliance with the provisions of Directive 94/57/EC;
(g) 'document of compliance' means the document issued to companies in conformity with paragraph 13.2 of the ISM Code;
Article 3
1. All companies shall comply with all the provisions of paragraphs 1.2 to 13.1 and of paragraph 13.3 of the ISM Code, as if the provisions thereof were mandatory, as a requirement for their vessels to provide regular services to or from a port of a Member State of the Community.
1. Member States shall comply with the provisions of paragraphs 13.2, 13.4 and 13.5 of the ISM Code as if the provisions thereof were mandatory, in relation to companies and ro-ro ferries.
3. The document of compliance shall only be valid for five years from the date of its issue, provided always that a verification takes place once a year, in order to confirm the proper functioning of the safety management system, and to confirm that possible modifications introduced since the latest verification satisfy the provisions of the ISM Code.
6. A Member State shall recognize the documents of compliance and safety management certificates issued by, or on behalf of, the administrations of third countries if it is satisfied that they demonstrate compliance with the provisions of this Regulation.
Member States shall satisfy themselves that all companies providing regular ro-ro ferry services to or from their ports comply with the provisions of this Regulation.
In the above circumstances the following procedure shall apply:
Article 9
(b) the periods of validity of the document of compliance and/or the safety management certificate and the frequency of verification relating thereto in Article 5 (3) and (4);
1. The Commission shall be assisted by the Committee established by Article 12 (1) of Council Directive 93/75/EEC (1).
(b) If the measures envisaged are not in accordance with the opinion of the committee, or if no opinion is delivered, the Commission shall, without delay, submit to the Council a proposal relating to the measures to be taken. The Council shall act by a qualified majority.
By way of derogation from the first subparagraph, this Regulation shall not apply until 31 December 1997 to companies which are incorporated under Greek law, which have their principal place of business in Greece, and which operate ro-ro- ferries registered in and flying the flag of Greece providing regular services exclusively between ports situated in Greece.

The description shall cover envisaged changes to the methodology of implementation, work to be carried out, difficulties foreseen and proposals for overcoming them, the implications for national and Community resources and proposals for improvements at Community level. Actions for which Community financial support is required shall be identified.
Financial provisions
3. The contribution shall be made available to Member States each year after submission and approval by the Commission of the annual report on the implementation, during the previous year, of the action envisaged. The Commission shall carry out any on-the-spot checks it deems necessary in collaboration with the competent authorities of the Member States.
Where necessary to achieve the purposes of this Decision and for the duration of a technical action plan the Commission, acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 10, may approve a Member State's request to be allowed to adapt one or more of the following features of the agricultural statistical surveys listed in Annex IV: regions covered, territorial sub-divisions, definitions, survey methodology, survey date, list of characteristics and size of classes.
The Commission may modify Annex I (statistical areas in which potential savings have been identified) and Annex II (statistical areas where there are new or increasing needs) in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 10. It shall inform the European Parliament and the Council of these modifications.

The votes of the representatives of the Member States within the Committee shall be weighted in the manner set out in that Article. The Chairman shall not vote.
If within three months from the date of referral to the Council, the Council has not acted, the proposed measures shall be adopted by the Commission.
Before 1 November 1997 the Commission, having consulted the Standing Committee on Agricultural Statistics, shall make a report on the progress of this Decision to the European Parliament and to the Council accompanied if necessary by proposals for its extension.
COMMISSION DECISION of 20 May 1996 concerning the placing on the market of genetically modified male sterile chicory (Cichorium intybus L.) with partial tolerance to the herbicide glufosinate ammonium pursuant to Council Directive 90/220/EEC (Text with EEA relevance) (96/424/EC)
Having regard to Council Directive 90/220/EEC of 23 April 1990 on the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms (1), as last amended by Commission Directive 94/15/EC (2), and in particular Article 13 thereof,
Whereas, the competent authority of the Netherlands has subsequently forwarded the dossier thereon to the Commission with a favourable opinion; whereas the competent authorities of other Member States have raised objections to the said dossier;
- there is no reason to believe that there will be any adverse effects from the transfer of the bar gene to wild chicory populations given the fact that such transfer could only confer a competitive or selective advantage to wild populations if the herbicide glufosinate-ammonium were the only means of controlling these populations, which is not the case,
- since 50 % of the hybrid seeds are tolerant to the herbicide, the label should mention that the product may be tolerant to the herbicide glufosinate-ammonium, so that breeders become aware that it may not be possible to control volunteers by glufosinate ammonium;
Whereas the measures provided for in this decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee of Member States representatives established under Article 21 of Directive 90/220/EEC,
1. Without prejudice to other Community legislation and subject to the conditions outlined in paragraphs 2, 3 and 4, consent shall be given by the authorities of the Netherlands for the placing on the market of the following product, notified by Bejo-Zaden BV (Ref. C/NL/94/25), under Article 13 of Directive 90/220/EEC.
(ii) the bar gene from Streptomyces hygroscopicus (a phosphinothricin acetyltransferase) with the promoter PSsuAra-tp from Arabidopsis thaliana and the TL-DNA gene 7 terminator from Agrobacterium tumefaciens;
3. The present consent covers the use of the product for breeding activities.
- and may be tolerant to the herbicide glufosinate ammonium.

Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1256/96 of 20 June 1996 applying multiannual schemes of generalized tariff preferences from 1 July 1996 to 30 June 1999 in respect of certain agricultural products originating in developing countries (2), and in particular Article 12 (3) thereof,
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (5),
Whereas on 7 June 1995 the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) and the European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC) made a joint complaint to the Commission under Article 9 of Regulation (EC) No 3281/94 and called for Myanmar to be temporarily withdrawn from the Community scheme of generalized tariff preferences because of its use of forced labour;
Whereas the Myanmar authorities were formally notified of the opening of the investigation; whereas they denied that the practices referred to in the complaint constituted forced labour, citing the exceptions in Article 2 (2) of ILO Convention No 29, and claiming that those exceptions covered the 1907 Town Act and the 1908 Village Act, which allow the population to be made to carry out works and services; whereas that interpretation has been challenged by the ILO, whose competent bodies have called for the immediate repeal of the laws in question in order to ensure compliance with the letter and the spirit of Convention No 29;
Whereas the evidence gathered during the Commission's investigation of the initial complaint by the ICFTU and ETUC and the resulting conclusions are broad enough in scope to provide a valid basis for examining the extended complaint lodged by those organizations on 2 January 1997, thus rendering a specific investigation of the agricultural sector unnecessary; whereas the requirements of Article 9 (2) of Regulation (EC) No 1256/96 have thus been met and the conditions laid down in Article 11 (5) of that Regulation have been fulfilled;
Whereas the fact that the practices condemned have been routine and widespread means that a complete withdrawal of access to the arrangements is warranted;
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 2
This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Whereas, in relation to products, the terms 'not put up for sale` and 'withdrawn from the market` should be treated as equivalent and should be included in a single definition; whereas it should also be clarified that the provisions on packaging requirements do not apply to the products withdrawn from the market;

Article 11
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 43 thereof,
Having regard to the Opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),
Whereas, through the protection of potato and tomato cultivation against such harmful organisms, not only should productive capacity be maintained but agricultural productivity should also be increased;

(3) Whereas in Directive 73/238/EEC (5) the Council decided upon appropriate measures - including drawing on oil stocks - to be taken in the event of difficulties in the supply of crude oil and petroleum products to the Community; whereas Member States have undertaken similar obligations in the Agreement on an 'International Energy Programme`;
(6) Whereas the provisions of this Directive do not affect the full application of the Treaty, in particular the provisions concerning the internal market and competition;
(9) Whereas organisational arrangements for the maintenance of stocks should ensure the stocks' availability and their accessibility to the consumer;
(12) Whereas indigenous production contributes in itself to security of supply; whereas the oil market evolution can justify an appropriate derogation from the obligation to maintain oil stocks for Member States with indigenous oil production; whereas, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, Member States may exempt undertakings from the obligation to maintain stocks in respect of an amount not exceeding the quantity of products which those undertakings manufacture from indigenously produced crude oil;
(15) Whereas oil stocks can, in principle, be held anywhere in the Community and, therefore, it is appropriate to facilitate the establishment of stocks outside national territory; whereas it is necessary that decisions for holding stocks outside national territory are taken by the Government of the Member State concerned according to its needs and supply security considerations; whereas in the case of stocks held at the disposal of another undertaking, or body/entity, more detailed rules are needed to guarantee their availability and accessibility in the event of oil supply difficulties;
(18) Whereas Directive 72/425/EEC raised from 65 to 90 days the reference period appearing in the first paragraph of Article 1 of Directive 68/414/EEC and laid down the conditions to implement this increase; whereas that Directive has been rendered obsolete by this Directive; whereas Directive 72/425/EEC should therefore be repealed;
Article 1
2. That part of internal consumption met by derivatives of petroleum produced indigenously by the Member State concerned may be deducted up to a maximum of 25 % of the said consumption. The distribution within the Member States of the result of such a deduction shall be decided by the Member State concerned.`;2. Article 2 shall be deleted;
'Article 4
In the statistical summary, stocks of jet fuel of the kerosene type shall be reported separately under category II.`;6. Article 5 shall be replaced by the following:

- on the basis of the ratio between the total quantity manufactured during the preceding calendar year in the State concerned of products covered by the obligation to maintain stocks and the total amount of crude oil used during that year; the foregoing shall apply to not more than 40 % of the total obligation for the first and second categories (petrol and gas oils), and to not more than 50 % for the third category (fuel oils).
'1. When calculating the level of minimum stocks provided for in Article 1, only those quantities which would be held in accordance with Article 3(1) shall be included in the statistical summary.`;(b) Paragraph 2 shall be replaced by the following:
In such cases, together with the statistical summary provided for by Article 4, each Member State shall send a report to the Commission concerning the stocks maintained within its own territory for the benefit of another Member State, as well as the stocks held in other Member States for its own benefit. In both cases, the storage locations and/or companies holding the stocks, quantities and product category - or crude oil - stored will be indicated in the report.
- they must relate to crude oil and to all petroleum products covered by this Directive,
- they must as a general rule be concluded for an unlimited period,

Article 15
Directive 2001/108/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee(2),
(1) The scope of Council Directive 85/611/EEC(4) was confined initially to collective investment undertakings of the open-ended type which promote the sale of their units to the public in the Community and the sole object of which is investment in transferable securities (UCITS). It was envisaged in the preamble to Directive 85/611/EEC that collective investment undertakings falling outside its scope would be the subject of coordination at a later stage.
(4) Money market instruments cover those transferable instruments which are normally not traded on regulated markets but dealt in on the money market, for example treasury and local authority bills, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, medium-term notes and bankers' acceptances.
(7) The development of opportunities for a UCITS to invest in UCITS and in other collective investment undertakings should be facilitated. It is therefore essential to ensure that such investment activity does not diminish investor protection. Owing to the enhanced possibilities for UCITS to invest in the units of other UCITS and/or collective investment undertakings, it is necessary to lay down certain rules on quantitative limits, the disclosure of information and prevention of the cascade phenomenon.
(10) For prudential reasons it is necessary to avoid excessive concentration by a UCITS in investments which expose them to counterparty risk to the same entity or to entities belonging to the same group.
(13) Operations in derivatives may never be used to circumvent the principles and rules set out in this Directive. With regard to OTC derivatives, additional risk-spreading rules should apply to exposures to a single counterparty or group of counterparties.
(16) There is a need to ensure the free cross-border marketing of the units of a wider range of collective investment undertakings, while providing a uniform minimum level of investor protection. Therefore, only a binding Community Directive laying down agreed minimum standards can achieve the desired objectives. This Directive effects only the minimum harmonisation required and does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve the objectives pursued in accordance with the third paragraph of Article 5 of the Treaty.
HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:
1. in Article 1(2), the first indent shall be replaced by the following: "- the sole object of which is the collective investment in transferable securities and/or in other liquid financial assets referred to in Article 19(1) of capital raised from the public and which operates on the principle of risk-spreading and";
- bonds and other forms of securitised debt ('debt securities'),
9. For the purposes of this Directive 'money market instruments' shall mean instruments normally dealt in on the money market which are liquid, and have a value which can be accurately determined at any time.";
5. in Article 19(1):
- such other collective investment undertakings are authorised under laws which provide that they are subject to supervision considered by the UCITS' competent authorities to be equivalent to that laid down in Community law, and that cooperation between authorities is sufficiently ensured,
- no more than 10 % of the UCITS' or the other collective investment undertakings' assets, whose acquisition is contemplated, can, according to their fund rules or instruments of incorporation, be invested in aggregate in units of other UCITS or other collective investment undertakings, and/or
- the underlying consists of instruments covered by this paragraph, financial indices, interest rates, foreign exchange rates or currencies, in which the UCITS may invest according to its investment objectives as stated in the UCITS' fund rules or instruments of incorporation,
(h) money market instruments other than those dealt in on a regulated market, which fall under Article 1(9), if the issue or issuer of such instruments is itself regulated for the purpose of protecting investors and savings, and provided that they are:
- issued or guaranteed by an establishment subject to prudential supervision, in accordance with criteria defined by Community law, or by an establishment which is subject to and complies with prudential rules considered by the competent authorities to be at least as stringent as those laid down by Community law; or
7. Article 19(2)(b) and (3) shall be deleted;
1. The management or investment company must employ a risk-management process which enables it to monitor and measure at any time the risk of the positions and their contribution to the overall risk profile of the portfolio; it must employ a process for accurate and independent assessment of the value of OTC derivative instruments. It must communicate to the competent authorities regularly and in accordance with the detailed rules they shall define, the types of derivative instruments, the underlying risks, the quantitative limits and the methods which are chosen in order to estimate the risks associated with transactions in derivative instruments regarding each managed UCITS.
3. A UCITS shall ensure that its global exposure relating to derivative instruments does not exceed the total net value of its portfolio.
When a transferable security or money market instrument embeds a derivative, the latter must be taken into account when complying with the requirements of this Article.
1. A UCITS may invest no more than 5 % of its assets in transferable securities or money market instruments issued by the same body. A UCITS may not invest more than 20 % of its assets in deposits made with the same body.
- 5 % of its assets, in other cases.
- investments in transferable securities or money market instruments issued by,
When a UCITS invests more than 5 % of its assets in the bonds referred to in the first subparagraph and issued by one issuer, the total value of these investments may not exceed 80 % of the value of the assets of the UCITS.
The limits provided for in paragraphs 1, 2, 3 and 4 may not be combined, and thus investments in transferable securities or money market instruments issued by the same body or in deposits or derivative instruments made with this body carried out in accordance with paragraphs 1, 2, 3 and 4 shall under no circumstances exceed in total 35 % of the assets of the UCITS.
11. the following Article shall be inserted: "Article 22a
- the index represents an adequate benchmark for the market to which it refers,
12. in Article 23(1), the words "and money market instruments" shall be added after the words "transferable securities";
2. Investments made in units of collective investment undertakings other than UCITS may not exceed, in aggregate, 30 % of the assets of the UCITS.
A UCITS that invests a substantial proportion of its assets in other UCITS and/or collective investment undertakings shall disclose in its prospectus the maximum level of the management fees that may be charged both to the UCITS itself and to the other UCITS and/or collective investment undertakings in which it intends to invest. In its annual report it shall indicate the maximum proportion of management fees charged both to the UCITS itself and to the UCITS and/or other collective investment undertaking in which it invests.";
2. When a UCITS invests principally in any category of assets defined in Article 19 other than transferable securities and money market instruments or replicates a stock or debt securities index in accordance with Article 22a, its prospectus and, where necessary, any other promotional literature must include a prominent statement drawing attention to the investment policy.
15. in Article 25(2):
16. in Article 25(2), the second sentence shall be replaced by the following: "The limits laid down in the second, third and fourth indents may be disregarded at the time of acquisition if at that time the gross amount of the debt securities or of the money market instruments, or the net amount of the securities in issue, cannot be calculated.";
19. Article 26(1) shall be replaced by the following: "1. UCITS need not comply with the limits laid down in this section when exercising subscription rights attaching to transferable securities or money market instruments which form part of their assets.
22. after Article 53 the following Article shall be inserted: "Article 53a
- alignment of terminology and the framing of definitions in accordance with subsequent acts on UCITS and related matters.
3. The Committee shall adopt its rules of procedure."
(a) analyse how to deepen and broaden the single market for UCITS, in particular with regard to cross-border marketing of UCITS (including third-party funds), the functioning of the passport for management companies, the functioning of the simplified prospectus as an information and marketing tool, the review of the scope of ancillary activities and the possibilities for improved collaboration of supervisory authorities with respect to common interpretation and application of the Directive;
(d) review the investment rules for UCITS, for example the use of derivatives and other instruments and techniques relating to securities, the regulation of index funds, the regulation of money market instruments, deposits, the regulation of "fund of fund" investments, as well as the various investment limits;
2. Member States may grant UCITS existing on the date of entry into force of this Directive a period of not more than 60 months from that date in order to comply with the new national legislation.
They shall apply these measures no later than 13 February 2004.
This Directive shall enter into force on the date of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
Commission Regulation (EC) No 70/2001
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having published a draft of this Regulation(2),
(1) Regulation (EC) No 994/98 empowers the Commission to declare, in accordance with Article 87 of the Treaty, that under certain conditions aid to small and medium-sized enterprises is compatible with the common market and not subject to the notification requirement of Article 88(3) of the Treaty.
(4) This Regulation is without prejudice to the possibility for Member States of notifying aid to small and medium-sized enterprises. Such notifications will be assessed by the Commission in particular in the light of the criteria set out in this Regulation. The guidelines on State aid for small and medium-sized enterprises should be abolished from the date of entry into force of this Regulation, since their contents are replaced by this Regulation.
(7) This Regulation should apply without prejudice to special rules in regulations and directives concerning State aid in certain sectors, such as currently exist for shipbuilding, and should not apply to agriculture and fisheries and aquaculture.
(10) In order to determine whether or not aid is compatible with the common market pursuant to this Regulation, it is necessary to take into consideration the aid intensity and thus the aid amount expressed as a grant equivalent. The calculation of the grant equivalent of aid payable in several instalments and aid in the form of a soft loan requires the use of market interest rates prevailing at the time of grant. With a view to a uniform, transparent, and simple application of the State aid rules, the market rates for the purposes of this Regulation should be deemed to be the reference rates, provided that, in the case of a soft loan, the loan is backed by normal security and does not involve abnormal risk. The reference rates should be those which are periodically fixed by the Commission on the basis of objective criteria and published in the Official Journal of the European Communities and on the Internet.
(13) It is appropriate to establish further conditions that should be fulfilled by any aid scheme or individual aid exempted by this Regulation. Having regard to Article 87(3)(c) of the Treaty, such aid should not normally have the sole effect of continuously or periodically reducing the operating costs which the beneficiary would normally have to bear, and should be proportionate to the handicaps that have to be overcome in order to secure the socioeconomic benefits deemed to be in the Community interest. It is therefore appropriate to limit the scope of this Regulation to aid granted in relation to certain tangible and intangible investments, certain services supplied to beneficiaries and certain other activities. In the light of Community overcapacity in the transport sector, with the exception of railway rolling stock, eligible investment costs for enterprises having their main economic activity in the transport sector should not include transport means and equipment.
(16) In the light of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures(7), this Regulation should not exempt export aid or aid favouring domestic over imported products. Aid towards the costs of participation in trade fairs or of studies or consultancy services needed for the launch of a new or existing product on a new market does not normally constitute export aid.
(19) This Regulation should not exempt aid cumulated with other State aid, including aid granted by national, regional or local authorities, or with Community assistance, in relation to the same eligible costs, when such cumulation exceeds the thresholds fixed in this Regulation.
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
1. Without prejudice to special Community Regulations or Directives under the EC Treaty governing the granting of State aid in specific sectors, whether more or less restrictive than this Regulation, this Regulation applies to aid granted to small and medium-sized enterprises in all sectors.
(b) to aid to export-related activities, namely aid directly linked to the quantities exported, to the establishment and operation of a distribution network or to other current expenditure linked to the export activity;
Definitions
(b) "small and medium-sized enterprises" shall mean enterprises as defined in Annex I;
(e) "gross aid intensity" shall mean the aid amount expressed as a percentage of the project's eligible costs. All figures used shall be taken before any deduction for direct taxation. Where aid is awarded in a form other than a grant, the aid amount shall be the grant equivalent of the aid. Aid payable in several instalments shall be discounted to its value at the moment of granting. The interest rate to be used for discounting purposes and for calculating the aid amount in a soft loan shall be the reference rate applicable at the time of grant;
Article 3
2. Aid schemes fulfilling all the conditions of this Regulation shall be compatible with the common market within the meaning of Article 87(3) of the Treaty and shall be exempt from the notification requirement of Article 88(3) of the Treaty provided that:
3. Aid granted under the schemes referred to in paragraph 2 shall be compatible with the common market within the meaning of Article 87(3) of the Treaty and shall be exempt from the notification requirement of Article 88(3) of the Treaty provided that the aid granted directly fulfils all the conditions of this Regulation.
1. Aid for investment in tangible and intangible assets inside or outside the Community shall be compatible with the common market within the meaning of Article 87(3) of the Treaty and shall be exempt from the notification requirement of Article 88(3) of the Treaty if it fulfils the conditions of paragraphs 2 to 6.
(b) 7,5 % in the case of medium-sized enterprises.
(b) 15 percentage points gross in areas covered by Article 87(3)(a), provided that the total net aid intensity does not exceed 75 %.
5. In cases where the aid is calculated on the basis of the investment's costs, the eligible costs of tangible investment shall be the costs relating to investment in land, buildings, machinery and equipment. In the transport sector, except for railway rolling stock, transport means and transport equipment shall not be included in the eligible costs. The eligible costs of intangible investment shall be the costs of acquisition of the technology.
(b) the investment project shall lead to a net increase in the number of employees in the establishment concerned, compared with the average over the previous twelve months; and
Consultancy and other services and activities
(b) for participation in fairs and exhibitions, the gross aid shall not exceed 50 % of the additional costs incurred for renting, setting up and running the stand. This exemption shall only apply to the first participation of an enterprise in a particular fair or exhibition.
This Regulation shall not exempt an individual aid grant where one of the following thresholds is met:
(ii) in areas which qualify for regional aid, the net aid intensity is at least 50 % of the net aid ceiling as determined in the regional aid map for the area concerned; or
Necessity for the aid
- the Member State has adopted legal provisions establishing a legal right to aid according to objective criteria and without further exercise of discretion by the Member State.
1. The aid ceilings fixed in Articles 4, 5 and 6 shall apply regardless of whether the support for the aided project is financed entirely from State resources or is partly financed by the Community.
Transparency and monitoring
3. Member States shall compile a report on the application of this Regulation in respect of each whole or part calendar year during which this Regulation applies, in the form laid down in Annex III, also in computerised form. Member States shall provide the Commission with such report no later than three months after the expiry of the period to which the report relates.
1. This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
amending Regulation (EC) No 562/2000 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 as regards the buying-in of beef, and Regulation (EC) No 2734/2000
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in beef and veal(1), and in particular Article 47(8) thereof,
(2) In view of this exceptional market situation and to improve the effectiveness of the intervention measures provided for in Regulation (EC) No 2734/2000, Article 4(2)(g) of Regulation (EC) No 562/2000 should be derogated from as regards the maximum weight of carcases by not setting any weight limit for the two invitations to tender in February 2001 and by increasing the weight to 430 kg for the remaining invitations to tender in the first quarter of 2001, while still allowing the purchase of heavier animals but at a purchase price equal to the maximum authorised weight.
(5) Annex III of Regulation (EC) No 562/2000 sets out the provisions applying to carcases, half-carcases and quarters that can be bought in. With a view to falling into line with current commercial practice, the description of the half-carcase in that Annex should be amended by introducing some margin of tolerance in the description.
(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Beef and Veal,
Article 6(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2734/2000 is replaced by the following:
- for the remaining invitations to tender in the first quarter of 2001, carcases of a weight greater than 430 kg may be bought in but the purchase price for them shall be that for this maximum weight."
1. Article 4(3)(d) is replaced by the following:
"(b) half-carcase: the product obtained by separating the carcase as referred to in (a) symmetrically through the middle of the cervical, dorsal, lumbar and sacral vertebrae and through the middle of the sternum and the ischiopubic symphysis. During carcase processing, the dorsal and lumbar vertebrae must not be seriously dislocated; associated muscles and tendons must not show any serious damage from saws or knives."
Commission Regulation (EC) No 749/2001
(Text with EEA relevance)
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 of 26 June 1990 laying down a Community procedure for the establishment of maximum residue limits of veterinary medicinal products in foodstuffs of animal origin(1), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2908/2000(2), and in particular Articles 7 and 8 thereof,
(2) Maximum residue limits should be established only after the examination within the Committee for Veterinary Medicinal Products of all the relevant information concerning the safety of residues of the substance concerned for the consumer of foodstuffs of animal origin and the impact of residues on the industrial processing of foodstuffs.
(5) In the case of veterinary medicinal products intended for use in laying birds, lactating animals or honey bees, maximum residue limits must also be established for eggs, milk or honey.
(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Veterinary Medicinal Products,
Annex II to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 is hereby amended as set out in the Annex hereto.
Commission Regulation (EC) No 939/2001
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Whereas:
(3) Article 6(1) of Council Regulation (EC) No 2406/96 of 26 November 1996 laying down common marketing standards for certain fishery products(7), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2578/2000(8), provides that products that are classified as category B are ineligible for the financial assistance granted in respect of withdrawal as provided for in the common market organisation. Given that only Extra, "E" and "A" quality products are eligible for the flat-rate aid described in Article 24 of Regulation (EC) No 104/2000, the calculation of the quantities eligible for this aid should be based on these categories of products only.
(6) The Member States should be authorised to fix the standard value used in calculating the flat-rate aid broken down according to the destination of the products withdrawn as provided for in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1501/83 of 9 June 1983 on the disposal of certain fishery products which have been the subject of measures to stabilise the market(9), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1106/90(10).
(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Fishery Products,
General provisions
Flat-rate aid shall be paid to the producer organisation concerned only once the competent authorities in the Member State in question have satisfied themselves that the quantities in respect of which the aid is applied for do not exceed the limit given in Article 24(5) of Regulation (EC) No 104/2000.
Article 3
The Member States shall fix the standard value to be used in calculating the flat-rate compensation and the advances relating thereto, broken down according to the destination of the products withdrawn as referred to in Article 1(b), (c), and (d) of Regulation (EEC) No 1501/83.
Conditions for granting the flat-rate aid referred to in Article 24(4) of Regulation (EC) No 104/2000 (hereinafter referred to as "flat-rate premium")
2. The amount of the flat-rate premium shall be calculated on the basis of the real technical and financial costs of operations required for the stabilisation and storage of the products in question as recorded in the Community during the previous fishing year.
(b) labour costs relating to storage and release from storage;
(e) cost of transport from place of landing to place of processing.
Article 6
The flat-rate premium shall be paid to the producer organisation concerned only once the competent authorities in the Member State concerned have satisfied themselves that the quantities in respect of which the premium is applied for have been either processed and stored, or preserved, and subsequently placed back on the market, in accordance with Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 2814/2000.
Article 8
3. The amount of the advance payment or payments shall be determined on the basis of the provisional ratio of the quantities withdrawn to the quantities put up for sale during the period concerned. The calculation of the amount shall be adjusted two months after the month concerned on the basis of the transactions actually carried out and reported using the model set out in the Annex.
1. The Member States shall introduce a system of checks to verify that the information given in applications for payment corresponds to the quantities actually put up for sale and withdrawn from the market by the producer organisation concerned.
Article 10
Regulation (EEC) No 4176/88 is repealed.
of 22 May 2001
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 152(4)(b) thereof,
Having consulted the Committee of the Regions,
(1) Several distinct transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) have for a number of years been recognised as occurring separately in humans and animals. Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) was first recognised in bovine animals in 1986 and in the following years was recognised as occurring in other species of animal. A new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD) was described in 1996. Evidence continues to grow of the similarity between the BSE agent and that of the new variant of Creutzfeld-Jakob Disease.
(4) The Commission has obtained scientific opinions, in particular from the Scientific Steering Committee and the Scientific Committee on Veterinary Measures relating to Public Health, on several aspects of TSEs. Those opinions include advice on measures to reduce the potential risk for humans and animals resulting from exposure to infected animal products.
(7) A procedure should be established for the determination of the epidemiological status of a Member State, a third country and of one of their regions, hereinafter referred to as "countries or regions" with respect to BSE, on the basis of the incident propagation and human exposure risk, using information available. Member States and third countries which choose not to apply for their status to be determined should be classified in a category by the Commission on the basis of all the information available to it.
(10) Certain ruminant tissues should be designated as specified risk material on the basis of the pathogenesis of TSEs and the epidemiological status of the country or region of origin or residence of the animal concerned. The specified risk material should be removed and disposed of in a manner which avoids any risk to human or animal health. In particular, it should not be placed on the market to be used in the production of food, feed or fertiliser. However, provision should be made for an equivalent level of health protection by means of a screening test for TSEs carried out on individual animals as soon as it has been fully validated. Slaughter techniques presenting a risk of causing brain material to contaminate other tissues should not be permitted in countries or regions other than those presenting the lowest risk of BSE.
(13) In the event of official confirmation of the presence of a TSE, the competent authority should take all the necessary measures, including having the carcasse destroyed, carrying out an investigation in order to identify all animals at risk and placing movement restrictions on the animals and the products of animal origin identified as such. Owners should be compensated, as soon as possible, for the loss of animals and products of animal origin destroyed pursuant to this Regulation.
(16) The placing on the market of certain products of animal origin derived from bovine animals in high risk regions should be prohibited. However, that prohibition should not apply to certain products of animal origin produced under controlled conditions from animals which can be demonstrated not to pose a high risk of infection with a TSE.
(19) Trade measures for TSEs should be based on international standards, guidelines or recommendations, where they exist. However, scientifically justified measures resulting in a higher level of health protection may be adopted if measures based on the relevant international standards, guidelines or recommendations would not achieve the appropriate level of health protection.
(22) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedure for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(4).
HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
2. This Regulation shall not apply to:
(c) products of animal origin intended for exhibition, teaching, scientific research, special studies or analysis, provided those products are not eventually consumed or used by humans or by animals other than those kept for the research projects concerned;
Separation of live animals and of products of animal origin
Article 3
(a) TSEs: all transmissible spongiform encephalopathies with the exception of those occurring in humans;
(d) starting materials: raw materials or any other product of animal origin out of which, or with the help of which, the products referred to in Article 1(2)(a) and (b) are produced;
(g) specified risk material: the tissues specified in Annex V; unless otherwise indicated, it does not include products containing or derived from those tissues;
(j) sampling: the taking of samples, ensuring a statistically correct representation, from animals or their environment, or from products of animal origin, for the purpose of establishing a disease diagnosis, familial relationships, for health surveillance, or for the monitoring of the absence of microbiological agents or of certain materials in products of animal origin;
(m) alternative test: the tests referred to in Article 8(2) which are used as an alternative to the withdrawal of specified risk material.
Article 4
2. The safeguard measures shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 24(2) and shall be notified at the same time to the European Parliament, stating the reasons.
Article 5
Member States, and third countries wishing to be retained on the list of third countries approved for the export to the Community of the live animals or of the products covered by this Regulation, shall submit to the Commission an application for their BSE status to be determined, accompanied by the relevant information on the criteria set out in Annex II, Chapter A, and on the potential risk factors specified in Annex II, Chapter B, and their development over time.
After the International Office of Epizootic Diseases (OIE) has established a procedure for the classification of countries by category and if it has placed the applicant country in one of those categories, a re-assessment of the Community categorisation of the country concerned in accordance with the first subparagraph of this paragraph may be decided, if appropriate, in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 24(2).
The rapid tests shall be approved for that purpose in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 24(2) and entered on a list set out in Annex X, Chapter C, point 4.
4. Member States or third countries which have not submitted an application in accordance with paragraph 1 within six months of 1 July 2001 shall, with respect to the dispatch from their territory of live animals and products of animal origin, be considered as countries in category 5, referred to in Annex II, Chapter C, until they have submitted such an application.
The eligibility of third countries to export to the Community live animals, or products of animal origin for which this Regulation provides specific rules, under conditions based on their category as established by the Commission, shall be conditional upon their undertaking to notify the latter in writing as soon as possible of any epidemiological or other evidence which might lead to a change in BSE status.
CHAPTER III
Monitoring system
2. Each Member State shall inform the Commission and the other Member States, within the Standing Veterinary Committee, of the emergence of a TSE other than BSE.
Article 7
2. Furthermore, the prohibition referred to in paragraph 1 shall be extended to animals and products of animal origin in accordance with point 1 of Annex IV.
Third countries, or regions thereof, in category 5 shall not be permitted to export to the Community feed intended for livestock which contains protein derived from mammals or feed intended for mammals, except for dogs and cats, which contains processed protein derived from mammals.
Specified risk material
2. Paragraph 1 shall not apply to tissues from animals which have undergone an alternative test approved for that distinct purpose in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 24(2) and listed in Annex X, Chapter C, point 5, and applied under the conditions listed in point 5 of Annex V - and where the results of the test were negative.
4. The data relating to age set out in Annex V shall be adjusted regularly. Such adjustments shall be based on the latest proven scientific findings concerning the statistical probability of the occurrence of a TSE in the relevant age groups of the Community's bovine, ovine and caprine population.
6. Rules for the implementation of this Article shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 24(2).
1. The products of animal origin listed in Annex VI shall not be produced from ruminant material from countries or regions thereof which are placed in category 5 unless they are produced in accordance with the production processes approved in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 24(2).
4. Rules for the implementation of this Article shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 24(2).
1. Member States shall ensure that staff of the competent authority, of diagnostic laboratories and colleges of agriculture and veterinary medicine, official veterinarians, veterinary practitioners, slaughterhouse personnel and animal breeders, keepers and handlers have been given training in the clinical signs, epidemiology and, in the case of staff responsible for carrying out checks, in interpreting laboratory findings relating to TSEs.
CONTROL AND ERADICATION OF TSEs
Without prejudice to Directive 82/894/EEC(12), the Member States shall ensure that any animal suspected of being infected by a TSE is notified immediately to the competent authorities.
Article 12
If BSE is suspected in a bovine animal at a holding in a Member State, all other bovine animals from that holding shall be placed under an official movement restriction until the results of the examination are available.
Under the procedure referred to in Article 24(2) and by way of derogation from the requirements of the second, third and fourth subparagraphs of this paragraph, a Member State may be exempted from the application of official restrictions on the movement of animals if it applies measures offering equivalent safeguards.
4. Rules for the implementation of this Article shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 24(2).
1. When the presence of a TSE has been officially confirmed, the following measures shall be applied as soon as possible:
(c) all animals and products of animal origin referred to in Annex VII, point 2, that have been identified as being at risk by the inquiry referred to in (b), shall be killed and completely destroyed in accordance with Annex V, points 3 and 4.
If there is evidence that the holding where the affected animal was present when the TSE was confirmed is not likely to be the holding where the animal was exposed to the TSE, the competent authority may decide that both holdings or only the holding of exposure shall be placed under official control.
5. Without prejudice to Directive 82/894/EEC, the confirmed presence of any TSE other than BSE shall be notified to the Commission on an annual basis.
Contingency plan
CHAPTER V
Live animals, their semen, embryos and ova
3. Rules for the implementation of this Article shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 24(2).

Entry into force
of 28 June 2001
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
(1) Article 18 of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 states that producers of grapes intended for winemaking and producers of must and wine are required to make harvest declarations in respect of the most recent harvest and that producers of wine and must and commercial operators other than retailers must declare their stocks each year.
(4) However, producers who can provide all the necessary information required in a single declaration of wine production need not make two declarations. Very small producers can be exempted from making declarations as their total production accounts for a very small percentage of Community production.
(7) Information relating to areas could be inaccurate where the declarants have not had suitable means of verification at their disposal. Provision should therefore be made in such cases for penalties varying according to the seriousness of the inaccuracies in declarations presented.
(10) Council Regulation (EEC) No 2392/86(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1631/98(4), provides for the establishment of a Community vineyard register. The Member States with a complete register should be allowed to use certain data from that register if declarations do not provide them.
(13) With a view to ensuring the necessary consistency between the penalties provided for in this Regulation and those laid down to the same effect in Commission Regulation (EC) No 1623/2000(5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 545/2001(6), that Regulation should be amended and the penalties adapted accordingly.
Article 1
1. Natural or legal persons or groups of such persons who harvest grapes, hereinafter referred to as "harvesters", shall submit each year to the competent authorities in the Member States a harvest declaration for the administrative unit specified, containing at least the information specified in Table A and, where appropriate, Table B of the Annex hereto.
(a) harvesters whose entire grape production is intended for consumption unprocessed or for drying or for processing directly into grape juice;
(i) the name, first name and address of the wine-grower;
The cooperative winery or group shall check the accuracy of the data contained in this declaration against the information at its disposal.
(b) harvesters associated with or belonging to a wine cooperative or group who deliver the whole of their harvest to that wine cooperative or group as grapes and/or must, including the harvesters referred to in Article 4(4).
1. Natural or legal persons or groups of such persons, including winemaking cooperatives, who from the current year's harvest have produced wine and/or hold, at the dates specified in Article 11(1), products other than wine shall submit a production declaration each year containing at least the information specified in Table C of the Annex hereto to the competent authorities designated by the Member States.
4. Exemption from the obligation to submit a production declaration shall also be granted to harvesters belonging to or associated with a cooperative winery that is required to submit a declaration, who deliver their production of grapes to that winery but reserve the right to obtain by vinification a quantity of wine of less than 10 hectolitres for their family consumption.
Notwithstanding Article 4, Member States which have, in accordance with Regulation (EEC) No 2392/86, established an annually updated vineyard register or similar administrative control instrument may release the natural or legal persons, groups of such persons or harvesters referred to in that Article from the obligation to declare the area.
1. Each year natural or legal persons or groups of such persons other than private consumers and retailers shall declare the stocks of grape must, concentrated grape must, rectified concentrated grape must and wine held by them at 31 July to the competent authorities of the Member States. As regards Community wine products, such declarations shall not include those obtained from grapes harvested in the same calendar year.
The quantities referred to in the first subparagraph shall be determined by each Member State having regard in particular to the special features of trade and distribution.
1. The Member States shall draw up the model forms for the various declarations and shall ensure that these forms contain at least the items specified in Tables A, B, C and D of the Annex.
Member States shall adopt any control measures necessary to ensure the accuracy of the declarations.
- some of the information that must appear on the declarations referred to in Chapters I and II from other administrative acts may leave the declarations blank in this regard;
- some of the information that must appear on the declarations referred to in Chapter III from other administrative acts may leave the declarations blank in this regard,
For the purposes of making out the declarations referred to in Articles 2 and 4, "other wines" means wines obtained from grapes of varieties listed in the classification of vine varieties drawn up by the Member States in accordance with Article 19 of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 for the same administrative unit as both wine-grape varieties and, as the case may be, table-grape varieties, varieties for the production of dried grapes or varieties for the production of wine spirits.
The quantities of products to be entered in the declarations provided for in Articles 2, 4 and 6 shall be expressed in hectolitres of wine. The quantities of concentrated grape must and rectified concentrated grape must entered in the declarations referred to in Article 4 shall be expressed in hectolitres of those products.
The quantity of wine to be entered in the production declarations provided for in Article 4 shall be the total quantity obtained on completion of the principal alcoholic fermentation, including the wine lees.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
(1) In accordance with Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90, maximum residue limits must be established progressively for all pharmacologically active substances which are used within the Community in veterinary medicinal products intended for administration to food-producing animals.
(4) For the control of residues, as provided for in appropriate Community legislation, maximum residue limits should usually be established for the target tissues of liver or kidney. However, the liver and kidney are frequently removed from carcases moving in international trade, and maximum residue limits should therefore also always be established for muscle or fat tissues.
(7) In order to allow for the completion of scientific studies, the duration of the validity of the provisional maximum residue limits previously defined in Annex III to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 should be extended for cefalonium, morantel and metamizole.

Commission Decision
(2002/916/EC)
Having regard to Council Directive 93/5/EEC of 25 February 1993 on assistance to the Commission and cooperation by the Member States in the scientific examination of questions relating to food(1), and in particular the fourth indent of Article 3(2) thereof,
(2) Commission Decision 94/652/EC(3), as last amended by Decision 2001/773/EC(4), establishes the inventory and distribution of tasks to be undertaken within the framework of cooperation by Member States in the scientific examination of questions relating to food.
(5) Decision 94/652/EC should be amended accordingly.
Article 1
This Decision is addressed to the Member States.
establishing a general framework for informing and consulting employees in the European Community
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1),
Acting in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 251(4), and in the light of the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee on 23 January 2002,
(2) Point 17 of the Community Charter of Fundamental Social Rights of Workers provides, inter alia, that information, consultation and participation for workers must be developed along appropriate lines, taking account of the practices in force in different Member States.
(5) Having completed this second stage of consultation, management and labour have not informed the Commission of their wish to initiate the process potentially leading to the conclusion of an agreement.
(8) There is a need, in particular, to promote and enhance information and consultation on the situation and likely development of employment within the undertaking and, where the employer's evaluation suggests that employment within the undertaking may be under threat, the possible anticipatory measures envisaged, in particular in terms of employee training and skill development, with a view to offsetting the negative developments or their consequences and increasing the employability and adaptability of the employees likely to be affected.
(11) Further development of the internal market must be properly balanced, maintaining the essential values on which our societies are based and ensuring that all citizens benefit from economic development.
(14) All of these political, economic, social and legal developments call for changes to the existing legal framework providing for the legal and practical instruments enabling the right to be informed and consulted to be exercised.
(17) Since the objectives of the proposed action, as outlined above, cannot be adequately achieved by the Member States, in that the object is to establish a framework for employee information and consultation appropriate for the new European context described above, and can therefore, in view of the scale and impact of the proposed action, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve these objectives.
(20) This takes into account and is without prejudice to other national measures and practices aimed at fostering social dialogue within companies not covered by this Directive and within public administrations.
(23) The objective of this Directive is to be achieved through the establishment of a general framework comprising the principles, definitions and arrangements for information and consultation, which it will be for the Member States to comply with and adapt to their own national situation, ensuring, where appropriate, that management and labour have a leading role by allowing them to define freely, by agreement, the arrangements for informing and consulting employees which they consider to be best suited to their needs and wishes.
(26) The employer should be allowed not to inform and consult where this would seriously damage the undertaking or the establishment or where he has to comply immediately with an order issued to him by a regulatory or supervisory body.
(29) This Directive should not affect the provisions, where these are more specific, of Council Directive 98/59/EC of 20 July 1998 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to collective redundancies(5) and of Council Directive 2001/23/EC of 12 March 2001 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the safeguarding of employees' rights in the event of transfers of undertakings, businesses or parts of undertakings or businesses(6).
HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:
1. The purpose of this Directive is to establish a general framework setting out minimum requirements for the right to information and consultation of employees in undertakings or establishments within the Community.
Article 2
(a) "undertaking" means a public or private undertaking carrying out an economic activity, whether or not operating for gain, which is located within the territory of the Member States;
(d) "employee" means any person who, in the Member State concerned, is protected as an employee under national employment law and in accordance with national practice;
(g) "consultation" means the exchange of views and establishment of dialogue between the employees' representatives and the employer.
1. This Directive shall apply, according to the choice made by Member States, to:
Member States shall determine the method for calculating the thresholds of employees employed.
Article 4
2. Information and consultation shall cover:
(c) information and consultation on decisions likely to lead to substantial changes in work organisation or in contractual relations, including those covered by the Community provisions referred to in Article 9(1).
(a) while ensuring that the timing, method and content thereof are appropriate;
(d) in such a way as to enable employees' representatives to meet the employer and obtain a response, and the reasons for that response, to any opinion they might formulate;
Information and consultation deriving from an agreement
Confidential information
3. Without prejudice to existing national procedures, Member States shall provide for administrative or judicial review procedures for the case where the employer requires confidentiality or does not provide the information in accordance with paragraphs 1 and 2. They may also provide for procedures intended to safeguard the confidentiality of the information in question.
Member States shall ensure that employees' representatives, when carrying out their functions, enjoy adequate protection and guarantees to enable them to perform properly the duties which have been assigned to them.
1. Member States shall provide for appropriate measures in the event of non-compliance with this Directive by the employer or the employees' representatives. In particular, they shall ensure that adequate administrative or judicial procedures are available to enable the obligations deriving from this Directive to be enforced.
Link between this Directive and other Community and national provisions
3. This Directive shall be without prejudice to other rights to information, consultation and participation under national law.
Transitional provisions
(b) undertakings employing at least 100 employees or establishments employing at least 50 employees during the year following the date in point (a).
1. Member States shall adopt the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive not later than 23 March 2005 or shall ensure that management and labour introduce by that date the required provisions by way of agreement, the Member States being obliged to take all necessary steps enabling them to guarantee the results imposed by this Directive at all times. They shall forthwith inform the Commission thereof.

Article 5
of 5 November 2002
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 71 thereof,
Following consultation of the Committee of the Regions,
(1) Transport safety and environmental issues connected with transport are vital in ensuring sustainable mobility.
(4) The extension of the scope of Directive 92/6/EEC to vehicles of more than 3,5 tonnes designed for transporting goods or passengers was one of the measures advocated by the Council in its resolution of 26 June 2000 on the improvement of road safety(5), in accordance with the Commission communication of 20 March 2000 on priorities in EU road safety.
(7) Directive 92/6/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly,
Directive 92/6/EEC is hereby amended as follows:
For the purposes of this Directive, 'motor vehicle' means any power-driven vehicle falling within category M2, M3, N2 or N3, intended for use on the road and having at least four wheels and a maximum design speed exceeding 25 km/h.
Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that motor vehicles of categories M2 and M3 referred to in Article 1 may be used on the road only if equipped with a speed limitation device set in such a way that their speed cannot exceed 100 kilometres per hour.
1. Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that motor vehicles of categories N2 and N3 may be used on the road only if equipped with a speed limitation device set in such a way that their speed cannot exceed 90 kilometres per hour.
1. For motor vehicles of category M3 having a maximum mass of more than 10 tonnes and motor vehicles of category N3, Articles 2 and 3 shall be applied:
(i) from 1 January 1995, in the case of vehicles used for both national and international transport;
(a) to vehicles registered as from 1 January 2005;
(ii) from 1 January 2007 in the case of vehicles used solely for national transport operations.
1. The speed limitation devices referred to in Articles 2 and 3 must satisfy the technical requirements laid down in the Annex to Directive 92/24/EEC(8). However, all vehicles covered by this Directive and registered before 1 January 2005 may continue to be equipped with speed limitation devices which satisfy the technical requirements laid down by the competent national authorities.
"Article 6a
Article 2
Article 3
This Directive is addressed to the Member States.
on the supplementary supervision of credit institutions, insurance undertakings and investment firms in a financial conglomerate and amending Council Directives 73/239/EEC, 79/267/EEC, 92/49/EEC, 92/96/EEC, 93/6/EEC and 93/22/EEC, and Directives 98/78/EC and 2000/12/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Central Bank(3),
(1) The current Community legislation provides for a comprehensive set of rules on the prudential supervision of credit institutions, insurance undertakings and investment firms on a stand alone basis and credit institutions, insurance undertakings and investment firms which are part of respectively a banking/investment firm group or an insurance group, i.e. groups with homogeneous financial activities.
(4) Other international forums have also identified the need for the development of appropriate supervisory concepts with regard to financial conglomerates.
(7) The competent authorities should be able to assess at a group-wide level the financial situation of credit institutions, insurance undertakings and investment firms which are part of a financial conglomerate, in particular as regards solvency (including the elimination of multiple gearing of own funds instruments), risk concentration and intra-group transactions.
(10) The tasks of the coordinator should not affect the tasks and responsibilities of the competent authorities as provided for by the sectoral rules.
(13) Credit institutions, insurance undertakings and investment firms which have their head office in the Community can be part of a financial conglomerate, the head of which is outside the Community. These regulated entities should also be subject to equivalent and appropriate supplementary supervisory arrangements which achieve objectives and results similar to those pursued by the provisions of this Directive. To this end, transparency of rules and exchange of information with third-country authorities on all relevant circumstances are of great importance.
(16) Since the objective of the proposed action, namely the establishment of rules on the supplementary supervision of credit institutions, insurance undertakings and investment firms in a financial conglomerate, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale and the effects of the action, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve this objective. Since this Directive defines minimum standards, Member States may lay down stricter rules.
(19) Technical guidance and implementing measures for the rules laid down in this Directive may from time to time be necessary to take account of new developments on financial markets. The Commission should accordingly be empowered to adopt implementing measures, provided that these do not modify the essential elements of this Directive.
HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:

Article 2
of 27 June 2002
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee(2),
Whereas:
(3) In general terms, the Agency should represent the technical body providing the Community with the necessary means to act effectively to enhance overall maritime safety and ship pollution prevention rules. The Agency should assist the Commission in the continuous process of updating and developing Community legislation in the field of maritime safety and prevention of pollution by ships and should provide the necessary support to ensure the convergent and effective implementation of such legislation throughout the Community by assisting the Commission in performing the tasks assigned to the latter by existing and future Community legislation on maritime safety and ship pollution prevention.
(6) In order properly to carry out the tasks entrusted to the Agency, it is appropriate that its officials carry out visits to the Member States in order to monitor the overall functioning of the Community maritime safety and ship pollution prevention system. The visits should be carried out in accordance with a policy to be established by the Agency's Administrative Board and should be facilitated by the authorities of the Member States.
(9) In order to effectively ensure the accomplishment of the functions of the Agency, the Member States and the Commission should be represented on an Administrative Board entrusted with the necessary powers to establish the budget, verify its execution, adopt the appropriate financial rules, establish transparent working procedures for decision making by the Agency, approve its work programme, examine requests for technical assistance from Member States, define a policy for visits to the Member States and appoint the Executive Director. In the light of the highly technical and scientific mission and tasks of the Agency, it is appropriate for the Administrative Board to consist of one representative of each Member State and four representatives of the Commission, being members with a high level of expertise. In order further to ensure the highest level of expertise and experience in the Administrative Board and with a view to involving the sectors most closely concerned in the tasks of the Agency, the Commission should nominate independent professionals from these sectors as board members without the right to vote, on the basis of their personal merit and experience in the field of maritime safety and prevention of pollution by ships and not as representatives of particular professional organisations.

In a similar way, Regulation (EC) No 1073/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 May 1999 concerning investigations conducted by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF)(6) should apply without restriction to the Agency, which should accede to the Interinstitutional Agreement of 25 May 1999 between the European Parliament, the Council of the European Union and the Commission of the European Communities concerning internal investigations by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF)(7).

Start of the Agency's activities
Entry into force
Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee(2),
Whereas:
(3) In the light of those scientific opinions, a distinction should be drawn between the measures to be implemented, depending on the nature of animal by-products used. The possible uses of certain animal materials should be limited. Rules should be laid down for the use of animal by-products other than in feed and for their disposal.
(6) The European Parliament, in its resolution of 16 November 2000 on BSE and safety of animal feed(5), called for a ban on the use of animal protein in feed until the present Regulation enters into force.
(9) From October 1996, the Food and Veterinary Office of the Commission (FVO) carried out a number of rounds of inspections in Member States, to assess the presence and management of main risk factors and surveillance procedures with regard to BSE. Part of the assessment covered the systems of commercial rendering and other methods of animal waste disposal. General conclusions and a number of recommendations were drawn up following those inspections, with particular reference to the traceability of animal by-products.
(12) Specific rules should be laid down on controls for processing plants, with particular reference to detailed procedures for the validation of processing methods and for self-supervision of production.
(15) Community inspections should be carried out in the Member States to ensure uniform implementation of the health requirements. Such inspections should also include audit procedures.
(18) In the light of the above, a fundamental revision of the Community rules applicable to animal by-products appears to be necessary.
(21) Animal by-products that pass through the Community in transit, and those originating in the Community and destined for export, can create a risk for animal and public health within the Community. Certain requirements laid down by this Regulation should therefore apply to such movements.
(24) The Council and the Commission have adopted several Decisions implementing Directives 90/667/EEC and 92/118/EEC. Furthermore, Directive 92/118/EEC has been substantially amended and further amendments are to be made. Consequently, a great number of Community acts currently regulate the animal by-products sector and there is a need for simplification.
(27) Effective checks should be carried out on products imported into the Community. This can be achieved by implementing the controls laid down in Council Directive 97/78/EC of 18 December 1997 laying down the principles governing the organisation of veterinary checks on products entering the Community from non-member countries(12).
(30) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(16),
(b) the placing on the market and, in certain specific cases, the export and transit of animal by-products and those products derived therefrom referred to in Annexes VII and VIII.
(b) liquid milk and colostrum disposed of or used on the farm of origin;
(e) catering waste, unless:
(iii) destined for use in a biogas plant or for composting;
3. This Regulation shall not affect veterinary legislation having as its objective the eradication and control of certain diseases.
1. For the purpose of this Regulation, the following definitions shall apply:
(c) Category 2 material: animal by-products referred to in Article 5;
(f) farmed animal: any animal that is kept, fattened or bred by humans and used for the production of food (including meat, milk and eggs), wool, fur, feathers, skins or any other product of animal origin;
(i) competent authority: the central authority of a Member State competent to ensure compliance with the requirements of this Regulation or any authority to which that central authority has delegated that competence, in particular for the control of feedingstuffs; it shall also include, where appropriate, the corresponding authority of a non-member country;
(l) transit: a movement through the Community from one non-member country to another;
(o) specified risk material: material referred to in Annex V to Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 laying down rules for the prevention, control and eradication of certain transmissible spongiform encephalopathies(17).

This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
rectifying Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 relative to the starting date of the transitional period for the recognition of producer organisations
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1),
Whereas:
(3) It is therefore appropriate to rectify the error in Article 13(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96. Since the effects of that error could have negatively affected producer organisations having benefitted from the said transitional periods, it is appropriate to apply the corresponding provisions as from the date of application of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96,
Article 13(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 shall be replaced by: "1. Producer organisations recognised under Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72 before the entry into force of this Regulation and which are unable to qualify for recognition under Article 11 of this Regulation without a transitional period may continue to operate under the provisions of Title IV for two years as from 1 January 1997, provided that they remain in compliance with the requirements of the said Articles of Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72."

Regulation (EC) No 2099/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee(2),
Whereas:
(3) The role of COSS is to centralise the tasks of the committees set up under the Community legislation on maritime safety, the prevention of pollution from ships and the protection of shipboard living and working conditions and to assist and advise the Commission on all matters of maritime safety and prevention or reduction of pollution of the environment by shipping activities.
(6) The measures required to implement the aforesaid legislation should be adopted in accordance with Decision 1999/468/EC.
(9) However, it is necessary to draw a distinction between the provisions of a Community act making reference, for the purposes of their application, to an international instrument and Community provisions reproducing an international instrument in full or in part. In the latter case, the most recent amendments to the international instruments cannot in any case be rendered applicable until the Community provisions concerned have been amended.
(12) A specific conformity checking procedure should, however, be set up to enable the Commission, after consulting COSS, to take whatever measures may be necessary to exclude the risk of amendments to the international instruments being incompatible with the aforesaid legislation or Community policy on maritime safety, the prevention of pollution from ships and the protection of shipboard living and working conditions in force or with the objectives pursued by that legislation. Such a procedure should also prevent international amendments from lowering the standard of maritime safety achieved in the Community.
Article 1

Integration of amendments to international instruments in Community law
Conformity checking procedure
The conformity checking procedure may be used solely to make amendments to the Community maritime legislation in the fields expressly covered by the regulatory procedure and strictly within the framework of exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission.
The conformity checking procedure, including, if applicable, the procedures set up in Article 5(6) of Decision 1999/468/EC, shall be completed at least one month before the expiration of the period established internationally for the tacit acceptance of the amendment concerned or the envisaged date for the entry into force of said amendment.

This Decision is addressed to the Member States.
amending Council Directive 98/18/EC on safety rules and standards for passenger ships
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1),
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty(3),
(2) The definition of sea areas is crucial to determine the application of Directive 98/18/EC to different classes of passenger ships. The Directive includes a procedure for the publication of lists of sea areas that has proved difficult to implement. It is therefore necessary to establish a functional and transparent procedure, enabling effective monitoring of the implementation of the Directive.
(5) In view of the structural modifications that the existing ro-ro passenger ships may need to undergo in order to comply with the specific stability requirements, those requirements should be introduced over a period of years in order to allow to the part of the industry affected sufficient time to comply: to that end, a phasing-in timetable for existing ships should be provided. This phasing-in timetable should not affect the enforcement of the specific stability requirements in the sea areas covered by the Annexes to the Stockholm Agreement of 28 February 1996.
(8) It is important to apply appropriate measures to ensure the access in safe conditions of persons with reduced mobility to ships and high-speed passenger craft operating on domestic services in the Member States.
Article 1
"(ea) 'ro-ro passenger ship' means a ship carrying more than 12 passengers, having ro-ro cargo spaces or special category spaces, as defined in regulation II-2/A/2 contained in Annex I."
2. Article 4(2) shall be replaced by the following:
(b) publish the list in a public database available on the Internet site of the competent maritime authority;
"Article 6a
2. All ro-ro passenger ships of Classes A and B, the keel of which is laid or which are at a similar stage of construction before 1 October 2004 shall comply with Articles 6, 8 and 9 of Directive 2003/25/EC by 1 October 2010, unless they are phased out on that date or on a later date on which they reach the age of 30 years but in any case not later than 1 October 2015.
1. Member States shall ensure that appropriate measures are taken, based, where practicable, on the guidelines in Annex III to enable persons with reduced mobility to have safe access to all passenger ships of Classes A, B, C and D and to all high-speed passenger craft, used for public transport, the keel of which is laid or which are at a similar stage of construction on or after 1 October 2004.
Member States shall draw up a national action plan on how the guidelines shall be applied to such ships and craft. They shall forward that plan to the Commission not later than 17 May 2005.
Article 2
Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive before 17 November 2004. They shall forthwith inform the Commission thereof.
Commission Directive 2003/26/EC
(Text with EEA relevance)
Having regard to Directive 2000/30/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 June 2000 on the technical roadside inspection of the roadworthiness of commercial vehicles circulating in the Community(1), and in particular Article 8 thereof,
(2) The field of roadworthiness testing is embraced by Council Directive 96/96/EC of 20 December 1996 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to roadworthiness tests for motor vehicles and their trailers(2), as last amended by Commission Directive 2001/11/EC(3), which covers regular roadworthiness testing, and by Directive 2000/30/EC, which applies to the roadside inspections of heavy commercial vehicles for their roadworthiness. Both Directives use the same Committee and the same procedure for technical adaptations.
HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:
Article 2
2. Member States shall communicate to the Commission the texts of the provisions of national law that they adopt in the field governed by this Directive.
of 8 May 2003
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 175(1) thereof,
Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions(3),
(1) The European Council meeting at Gothenburg on 15 and 16 June 2001 agreed on a Community strategy for sustainable development consisting in a set of measures, which include the development of biofuels.
(4) The transport sector accounts for more than 30 % of final energy consumption in the Community and is expanding, a trend which is bound to increase, along with carbon dioxide emissions and this expansion will be greater in percentage terms in the candidate countries following their accession to the European Union.
(7) Increased use of biofuels for transport, without ruling out other possible alternative fuels, including automotive LPG and CNG, is one of the tools by which the Community can reduce its dependence on imported energy and influence the fuel market for transport and hence the security of energy supply in the medium and long term. However, this consideration should not detract in any way from the importance of compliance with Community legislation on fuel quality, vehicle emissions and air quality.
(10) Promoting the use of biofuels in transport constitutes a step towards a wider application of biomass which will enable biofuel to be more extensively developed in the future, whilst not excluding other options and, in particular, the hydrogen option.
(13) New types of fuel should conform to recognised technical standards if they are to be accepted to a greater extent by customers and vehicle manufacturers and hence penetrate the market. Technical standards also form the basis for requirements concerning emissions and the monitoring of emissions. Difficulties may be encountered in ensuring that new types of fuel meet current technical standards, which, to a large extent, have been developed for conventional fossil fuels. The Commission and standardisation bodies should monitor developments and adapt and develop actively standards, particularly volatility aspects, so that new types of fuel can be introduced, whilst maintaining environmental performance requirements.
(16) In its resolution of 8 June 1998(5), the Council endorsed the Commission's strategy and action plan for renewable energy sources and requested specific measures in the biofuels sector.
(19) In its resolution of 18 June 1998(6), the European Parliament called for an increase in the market share of biofuels to 2 % over five years through a package of measures, including tax exemption, financial assistance for the processing industry and the establishment of a compulsory rate of biofuels for oil companies.
(22) Promotion of the production and use of biofuels could contribute to a reduction in energy import dependency and in emissions of greenhouse gases. In addition, biofuels, in pure form or as a blend, may in principle be used in existing motor vehicles and use the current motor vehicle fuel distribution system. The blending of biofuel with fossil fuels could facilitate a potential cost reduction in the distribution system in the Community.
(25) An increase in the use of biofuels should be accompanied by a detailed analysis of the environmental, economic and social impact in order to decide whether it is advisable to increase the proportion of biofuels in relation to conventional fuels.
(28) Encouragement of the promotion of biofuels should be consistent with security of supply and environmental objectives and related policy objectives and measures within each Member State. In doing so, Member States may consider cost-effective ways of publicising the possibilities of using biofuels.
Article 1
1. For the purpose of this Directive, the following definitions shall apply:
(c) "other renewable fuels" means renewable fuels, other than biofuels, which originate from renewable energy sources as defined in Directive 2001/77/EC(8) and used for transport purposes;
(a) "bioethanol": ethanol produced from biomass and/or the biodegradable fraction of waste, to be used as biofuel;
(d) "biomethanol": methanol produced from biomass, to be used as biofuel;
(g) "bio-MTBE (methyl-tertio-butyl-ether)": a fuel produced on the basis of biomethanol. The percentage by volume of bio-MTBE that is calculated as biofuel is 36 %;
(j) "pure vegetable oil": oil produced from oil plants through pressing, extraction or comparable procedures, crude or refined but chemically unmodified, when compatible with the type of engines involved and the corresponding emission requirements.
(b) (i) A reference value for these targets shall be 2 %, calculated on the basis of energy content, of all petrol and diesel for transport purposes placed on their markets by 31 December 2005.
(a) as pure biofuels or at high concentration in mineral oil derivatives, in accordance with specific quality standards for transport applications;
3. Member States shall monitor the effect of the use of biofuels in diesel blends above 5 % by non-adapted vehicles and shall, where appropriate, take measures to ensure compliance with the relevant Community legislation on emission standards.
Article 4
- the national resources allocated to the production of biomass for energy uses other than transport, and
In these reports, differentiation of the national targets, as compared to the reference values referred to in Article 3(1)(b), shall be motivated and could be based on the following elements:
(c) national policies allocating comparable resources to the production of other transport fuels based on renewable energy sources and consistent with the objectives of this Directive.
(a) the cost-effectiveness of the measures taken by Member States in order to promote the use of biofuels and other renewable fuels;
(d) the sustainability of crops used for the production of biofuels, particularly land use, degree of intensity of cultivation, crop rotation and use of pesticides;
On the basis of this report, the Commission shall submit, where appropriate, proposals to the European Parliament and to the Council on the adaptation of the system of targets, as laid down in Article 3(1). If this report concludes that the indicative targets are not likely to be achieved for reasons that are unjustified and/or do not relate to new scientific evidence, these proposals shall address national targets, including possible mandatory targets, in the appropriate form.
Article 6
The period laid down in Article 5(6) of Decision 1999/468/EC shall be set at three months.
1. Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by 31 December 2004 at the latest. They shall forthwith inform the Commission thereof.
Article 8
This Directive is addressed to the Member States.
amending the Annexes to Council Directives 76/895/EEC, 86/362/EEC, 86/363/EEC and 90/642/EEC as regards the fixing of maximum levels for certain pesticide residues in and on cereals, foodstuffs of animal origin and certain products of plant origin, including fruit and vegetables
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 86/363/EEC of 24 July 1986 on the fixing of maximum levels for pesticide residues in and on foodstuffs of animal origin(4), as last amended by Directive 2002/79/EC, and in particular Article 10 thereof,
Whereas:
(3) The inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC of the active substances concerned was based on the assessment of the information submitted concerning the proposed use. Information relating to this use has been submitted by certain Member States in accordance with Article 4(1)(f) of Directive 91/414/EEC. The information available has been reviewed and is sufficient to allow certain maximum residue levels (MRLs) to be fixed.
(6) In order to allow legitimate expectations to be fulfilled for existing stocks of pesticides to be used, the Commission non-inclusion Decisions allowed a phasing-out period, and it is appropriate that MRLs premised on the notion that use of the substance concerned is not authorised in the Community, should not apply until the end of the phasing-out period applying to that substance.
(9) In order to ensure that the consumer is adequately protected from exposure to residues resulting from unauthorised uses of plant protection products, provisional MRLs should be set for the relevant product/pesticide combinations at the lower limit of analytical determination.
(12) To establish maximum levels of pesticide residues for diquat at Community level it is necessary to transfer provisions from Directive 76/895/EEC to Directives 86/362/EEC, 86/363/EEC and 90/642/EEC, delete these provisions in Directive 76/895/EEC and amend some of these provisions in the light of technical and scientific progress as well as changes in uses and authorisations at national and Community level.
Article 1
The maximum pesticide residue levels as shown in Annex I to this Directive are added to Part A of Annex II to Directive 86/362/EEC:
Article 4
Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by 30 June 2003 at the latest except for the provisions for fentin hydroxide, fentin acetate and chlorfenapyr, which shall be brought into force by 30 June 2004. They shall forthwith inform the Commission thereof.
Article 6
This Directive is addressed to the Member States.
