Whereas the coordination provided for in Article 54 (3) (g) and in the General Programme for the abolition of restrictions on freedom of establishment, which was begun by Directive 68/151/EEC (3), is especially important in relation to public limited liability companies, because their activities predominate in the economy of the Member States and frequently extend beyond their national boundaries;

Article 43
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (2),
Whereas, if these disparities are to be removed, thereby increasing agricultural productivity in this sector, intra-Community trade in all pure-bred breeding animals must be progressively liberalized ; whereas complete liberalization of trade requires a later additional harmonization particularly regarding approval for breeding;
Whereas it must be ensured that importation of pure-bred breeding animals of the bovine species from non-member countries cannot be carried out on conditions which are less severe than those applied within the Community,
For the purposes of this Directive the following definitions shall apply: (a) pure-bred breeding animal of the bovine species : any bovine animal the parents and grandparents of which are entered or registered in a herd-book of the same breed, and which is itself either entered or registered and eligible for entry in such a herd-book; (1)OJ No C 76, 3.7.1974, p. 52.

- the criteria governing the recognition of breeders' organizations and associations,
- the particulars to be shown on the pedigree certificate.
(c) the introduction of new herd-books shall continue to meet the conditions at present in force in each Member State.
Member States shall not authorize the import of pure-bred breeding animals of the bovine species from non-member countries unless they are accompanied by a pedigree certificate certifying that they are entered or registered in a herd-book in the exporting non-member country. Proof must be provided that the animals are either entered or registered and eligible for entry in a herd-book in the Community.
2. Within the Committee the votes of Member States shall be weighted as provided in Article 148 (2) of the Treaty. The Chairman shall not vote.

Whereas, in order to ensure the proper operation of the system aid, the rights and obligations of all those concerned, namely growers producer organizations and associations of producer organizations and also the Member States concerned should be laid down;
Whereas, in the interests of proper administration, producer organizations and associations thereof must apply to the competent national authorities for recognition in good time before the beginning of the marketing year; whereas the Member State concerned should decide on their application within a reasonable time;
Whereas, in order to ensure the proper operation of the system of production aid for growers who belong to producer organizations, provision should be made for paying aid only in respect of the quantities obtained in approved mills; whereas, for the purposes of approval, the mills concerned should fulfil a number of conditions;
Whereas experience has shown that, despite the large number of specific checks introduced, the number of growers to be supervised makes detailed and effective checking and verification difficult; whereas it is necessary to resolve these difficulties by setting up in each Member State a computerized file containing all the information needed to facilitate checking and the prompt detection of irregularities,
As from the 1984/85 marketing year, the general rules laid down in this Regulation shall apply to the granting of the production aid for olive oil referred to in Article 5 of Regulation No 136/66/EEC.
In the case of other olive growers, the aid shall be granted in accordance with the second indent of Article 5 (2) of Regulation No 136/66/EEC and shall be equal to that resulting from applying the olive yields and oil yields, fixed according to the standard method provided for in Article 18 to the number of olive trees in production.

To this end, olive growers shall submit to the producer organizations of which they are members the information needed to establish that they are persons exploiting an olive grove and information on any changes which have occurred since their application for membership.
Article 5
Recognition shall take effect from the beginning of the marketing year following that in which application was made.

- lodge the crop declarations of all their members in accordance with Article 3 (1),
All applications relating to the production of a single marketing year must, on pain of preclusion, be lodged before a date to be specified.
In cases where an olive grower who is a member of a producer organization
- has joined the organization during the marketing year,
- that the production of olives declared by each grower as having been pressed in an approved mill tallies with the particulars given on his crop declaration, on the basis of criteria to be determined,

(d) agree to keep standardized stock records meeting criteria to be determined.
Such provisional approval shall become definitive as soon as the Member State concerned has ascertained that the conditions for approval laid down in paragraph 1 are fulfilled.

- the sum referred to in Article 11 (1) (a).
Article 21
The Member States shall notify the Commission of the measures taken pursuant to this Regulation.
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 43 thereof,
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),
Whereas Directive 64/433/EEC relates only to fresh meat likely to be involved in intra-Community trade; whereas, however, the authorities of the Member States have introduced national controls for fresh meat intended solely for the national market;
Whereas, in order to remedy this situation, harmonized rules on the financing of the said health inspections and controls should be laid down;
Article 1
- in order both to ensure equivalence of treatment as provided for in Article 15 of Directive 71/118/EEC and to cover the costs provided for in Directive 72/462/EEC, provision is made for the collection of a fee on meat referred to in those Directives imported from third countries,
2. Member States shall be authorized to collect an amount exceeding the level or levels referred to in paragraph 1 provided that the total fee collected for each Member State remains lower than or equal to the real figure for inspection costs.
Article 4
Article 5
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2),
Whereas it nevertheless seems desirable that certain provisions be introduced to facilitate the effective exercise of the right of establishment;
Whereas, under their national policies in the sphere of public health, which seek inter alia to ensure the satisfactory dispensing of medicinal products over their entire territories, certain Member States restrict the number of new pharmacies that may be established, while others have adopted no such provisions; whereas in these circumstances it is premature to provide that the effects of the recognition of diplomas, certificates and other evidence of formal qualifications in pharmacy must also extend to the pursuit of the activities of pharmacist as the controller of a pharmacy open to the public for less than three years; whereas this problem must be re-examined by the Commission and the Council within a certain period;
Whereas this Directive does not affect the provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action in the Member States which prohibit companies from practising certain activities or impose on them certain conditions for such practice;
Whereas, as far as the activities of employed persons are concerned, Council Regulation (EEC) No 1612/68 of 15 October 1968 on freedom of movement for workers within the Community (1) lays down no specific provisions relating to good character or good repute, professional discipline or use of title for the professions covered; whereas, depending on the individual Member State, such rules are or may be applicable both to employed and self-employed persons; whereas the activities subject in the Member States to possession of a diploma, certificate or other evidence of formal qualification in pharmacy are pursued by both employed and self-employed persons, or by the same persons in both capacities in the course of their professional career; whereas, in order to encourage as far as possible the free movement of those professional persons within the Community, it therefore appears necessary to extend the application of this Directive to employed persons.
Article 2
Five years after the date stipulated in Article 19 (1), the Commission shall submit a report to the Council on the way in which Member States have implemented the preceding subparagraph and on the possibility of extending the effects of mutual recognition of the diplomas, certificates and other formal certificates referred to in paragraph 1. It shall make any appropriate proposals.
As long as the Hellenic Republic makes use of this derogation and without prejudice to Article 45 of the 1979 Act of Accession, the other Member States shall not be required to give effect as provided for in Article 2 to the certificates referred to in Article 4 (d) except in the case of the pursuit as an employed person in accordance with Regulation (EEC) No 1612/68 of the activities referred to in Article 1.
The diplomas, certificates and other evidence of formal qualifications referred to in Article 2 are the following:
(b) in Denmark:
(1) Zeugnis ueber die staatliche Pharmazeutische Pruefung (the State examination certificate in pharmacy) awarded by the competent authorities;
Piatopoiitikó ton armodíon archón, ikanótitas áskisis tis farmakeftikís, chorigoýmeno metá kratikí exétasi (the certificate attesting competence to pursue the activity of a pharmacist) issued by the competent authorities following a State examination;
(f) in Ireland:

Whereas Article 30 et sequitur of the Treaty, concerning the elimination of quantitative restrictions and all measures having equivalent effect, apply without distinction to products originating in the Community and those that have been put into free circulation in any of the Member States irrespective of their origin;
Whereas, however, the full application of these principles presupposes the effective establishment of a common commercial policy;
Whereas to this end the Commission is empowered to authorize the Member States to take intra-Community surveillance measures or protective measures, notwithstanding the principle of free movement within the Community of goods originating in third countries and put into free circulation in one of the Member States; whereas, however, Article 115 provides that these measures can be authorized only where necessary and that the Commission shall give priority to those measures which cause least disturbance to the functioning of the common market; whereas the result is that at the present stage of establishment of the common market the measures under Article 115 of the Treaty should be authorized only where deflections of trade lead to economic difficulties or jeopardize the effectiveness of commercial policy measures taken by Member States pursuant to the Community's international obligations;
Whereas, in cases where a surveillance measure is authorized, import documents must be issued automatically, free of charge, within a given period and for any quantity requested; whereas if surveillance measures are requested on the grounds that imports may lead in a Member State to economic difficulties, the reality of such danger should be assessed in the light of deflections of trade observed in the past and the level of the import opportunities granted by the Community to the third country in question;
Whereas it should be provided that, if necessary, the Commission may hold an inquiry to check the validity of the information at its disposal;

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2),
Whereas, in order that the said type-approval procedure may be comprehensive in its application, it is necessary that it cover components as well as separate technical units and that each concept should be accurately defined;
Whereas the administrative procedures governing the relationships between Member States, where one Member State demonstrates to the type-approving Member State that a number of vehicles do not conform to the approved type and that there is therefore reason to believe that production conformity has not been adequately ensured, need to be clarified;
Article 1
- "vehicle" means any motor vehicle intended for use on the road, with or without bodywork, having at least four wheels and a maximum design speed exceeding 25 km/h, and its trailers, with the exception of vehicles which run on rails and of agricultural tractors and machinery,
Article 2
- "agrément par type"/"typegoedkeuring" in Belgian law,
- "égkrisi týpoy," in Greek law,
- "type approval" in Irish law,
- "typegoedkeuring" in Netherlands law,
(b) "EEC type-approval" means the procedure whereby a Member State certifies that a vehicle type, separate technical unit or component satisfies the technical requirements of the separate directives and the checks listed in the EEC type-approval certificate, the model of which is given in Annex II, and, where applicable, completed by the Annex to the type-approval certificate as contained in the appropriate separate Directives.'
1. Each Member State shall approve all vehicle types which satisfy the following conditions:
2. A Member State granting type-approval shall take the necessary measures to verify, in so far as is necessary and if need be in cooperation with the competent authorities of the other Member States, that adequate arrangements have been made to ensure that vehicles in production conform to the approved type.
Article 5
3. The manufacturer or his authorized representative in the country of registration shall complete a certificate of conformity, the model of which is given in Annex III, for each vehicle manufactured in conformity with the approved type.
There shall be failure to conform to the approved type where deviations from the particulars in the type-approval certificate and/or the information document are found to exist and where these deviations have not been authorized under Article 6 (2) or (3) by the Member State which granted the type-approval. A vehicle shall not be considered to deviate from the approved type where tolerances are permitted by separate directives and these tolerances are respected.'
1. If a Member State which has granted EEC type-approval finds that a number of vehicles accompanied by a certificate of conformity do not conform to the type which it has approved, it shall take the necessary measures to ensure that production models once more conform to the approved type. The competent authorities of that State shall advise those of the other Member States of the measures taken, which may, where necessary, extend to withdrawal of EEC type-approval. 2. If a Member State demonstrates that a number of vehicles accompanied by a certificate of conformity do not conform to the approved type it may request the Member State which granted the EEC type-approval to verify that production models conform to the approved type. The Member State which granted the EEC type-approval shall conduct the requested conformity of production check, within six months of the date of request, with, if it is considered necessary, the cooperation of the Member State which requested that such a check be conducted.
4. If the Member State which granted EEC type-approval disputes the failure to conform notified to it, the Member States concerned shall endeavour to settle the dispute.
'Article 9a
3. However, the holder of EEC type-approval for a separate technical unit or a component granted in accordance with this Article shall complete the certificate provided for in Article 5 (3) and affix to each unit or component manufactured in conformity whith the approved type the trade name or mark, the type and, if the separate directive so provides, the type-approval number. In the latter case, these shall be no obligation to complete the certificate provided for in Article 5 (3).
'- on application by the manufacturer or his authorized representative and on submission of the information required by the separate directive, the Member State concerned shall complete the type approval certificate in accordance with the relevant separate directive. A copy of this certificate shall be issued to the applicant. With respect to vehicles of the same type, other Member States shall accept this copy as proof that the requisite tests have been carried out.'
Article 3
Article 4
Whereas the development of scientific and technical knowledge makes necessary certain amendments to the Annex to Directive 79/117/EEC;

Such molecules must be distributed over a range of molecular weights wherein differences in the molecular weight are primarily attributable to differences in the number of monomer units. In the context of this definition a "monomer unit" means the reacted form of a monomer in a polymer;
(e) "placing on the market" means the making available to third parties. Importation into the Community customs territory shall be deemed to be placing on the market for the purposes of this Directive;

In accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 17 of Regulation (EEC) No 2771/75, the Commission shall lay down the transitional measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation, in particular those referring to the use of existing packing material.
This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 43 thereof,
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),
Whereas control is first and foremost the responsibility of the Member States; whereas the Commission should also seek to ensure that the Member States monitor and prevent infringements in an equitable manner; whereas, therefore, the Commission should be provided with the financial, legal and legislative means to carry out this task as effectively as possible;
Whereas policy on the management of fishery resources, which is based in particular on total allowable catches (TACs) and quotas and technical measures, is to be supplemented by management of the fishing effort, which involves monitoring fishing activities and capacities;
Whereas implementation of the common fisheries policy necessitates measures to monitor vessels flying the flag of a third country present in Community waters, and in particular a system for communicating their movements and the species held on board, without prejudice to the right of innocent passage in the territorial sea and freedom of navigation in the 200-mile fishing zone;
Whereas it is necessary for the Member State of landing to be able to monitor landings on its territory, and to this end it is appropriate for fishing vessels registered in other Member States to notify the Member State of landing of their intention to land on its territory;
Whereas, in order to ensure the respect of Community conservation and trade measures, all fishery products landed in or imported into the Community should be accompanied, up to the point of first sale, by a transport document identifying their origin;
Whereas the Member States must be informed of the results of the activities of their vessels in waters under the jurisdiction of third countries or in international waters; whereas the masters of these vessels should accordingly be subject to the obligations relating to the logbook and the landing and transshipment declarations; whereas the information gathered by the Member States should be sent to the Commission;
Whereas it is necessary that, when the quota of a Member State is exhausted or when the TAC itself is exhausted, fishing should be prohibited by a Commission decision;
Whereas it is necessary, in order to guarantee efficient management of the measures adopted, to provide for declaration mechanisms in conformity with the management objectives and strategies as laid down in Article 8 of Regulation (EEC) No 3760/92, applicable to a Member State which has overfished its quota;
Whereas, in order to safeguard the objectivity of verifications, it is important that Community inspectors may, in certain conditions, effect missions without prior notice and in an independent way, so as to verify the control operations carried out by the competent authorities of Member States; whereas such missions will in no circumstances imply control of private persons;
Whereas Member States should report regularly to the Commission on their inspections activities and on the measures taken following infringements of Community measures;
Whereas this Regulation should not affect the national provisions on monitoring, which, while coming within its scope, go beyond its minimum provisions, provided however that such national provisions are in conformity with Community law;
Whereas the provisions of certain Articles, insofar as they concern fisheries operations in the Mediterranean Sea, where the common fisheries policy has not yet been integrally applied, should enter into force on 1 January 1989,
- structural measures,

To that end, they may set up joint inspection programmes to allow the inspection of Community fishing vessels in the waters referred to in paragraphs 1 and 3. They shall take measures to permit their competent authorities and the Commission to be regularly informed on a reciprocal basis of the experience gained.
2. In order to assets the technology to be used and the vessels to be included in the abovementioned system, Member States, in cooperation with the Commission, shall carry out pilot projects before 30 June 1995. To this end, Member States shall ensure that a continuous position monitoring system, either land- or satellite-based and using satellite communications for data transmission, is installed for certain categories of Community vessels.
Where its fishing vessels are operating in waters subject to the sovereignty or jurisdiction of another Member State, the flag Member State shall ensure immediate communication of these data to the competent authorities of the Member State concerned.
2. The persons responsible for the fishing vessels, premises or transport vehicles inspected shall cooperate in facilitating inspections carried out in accordance with paragraph 1.
(a) the identification of officially designated inspectors, of inspection vessels and of such other like means of inspection as may be used by a Member State;

1. All catches of a stock or group of stocks subject to quota made by Community fishing vessels shall be charged against the quota applicable to the flag Member State for the stock or group of stocks in question, irrespective of the place of landing.
When an assessment of this situation as referred to in the first subparagraph is made, the Commission shall advise the Member States concerned of the prospects of fishing being halted as a result of a TAC being exhausted.
If the prejudice suffered by the Member State for which fishing has been prohibited before its quota was exhausted has not been removed by action in accordance with Article 9 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 3760/92, measures shall be adopted with the aim of remedying in an appropriate manner the prejudice caused, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 36. These measures may involve making deductions from the quota, allocation or share of the Member State which has overfished, the quantities so deducted to be allocated appropriately to the Member Sates whose fishing activities were halted before their quotas were exhausted. These deductions and the consequent allocations shall be made taking into account as a matter of priority the species and zones for which the annual quotas, allocations or shares were fixed. These deductions or allocations may be made during the year in which the prejudice occurred or in the succeeding year or years.
Should the competent authorities of a Member State establish that the activities of a Community fishing vessel have seriously or repeatedly failed to comply with this Regulation, the flag Member State may subject the vessel in question to additional control measures.

COUNCIL REGULATION (EEC) No 3089/93 of 29 October 1993 amending Regulation (EEC) No 2299/89 on a code of conduct for computerized reservation systems
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),
Whereas Regulation (EEC) No 2299/89 (4) constitutes a significant step towards the achievement of undistorted competition between air carriers and between computer reservation systems, thereby protecting the interests of consumers;
Whereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 83/91 (5) exempts agreements for the common purchase development and operation of computer reservation systems from the provisions of Article 85 (1) of the Treaty;
Whereas, in principle, 'seat-only' or unbundled products on non-scheduled air services compete directly with air transport products offered on scheduled services;
Whereas consumers looking for different products should be given the possibility to request displays for only scheduled or non-scheduled flights;
Whereas a clear distinction between a contract for participation in or allowing for use of a system and the supply of the technical equipment itself is appropriate, the latter being subject to normal contract law, thus allowing a system vendor to claim his direct costs in the case of the termination of a participation or subscription contract in accordance with the provisions of this Regulation;
Whereas competitive parity will be enhanced by ensuring the separate legal identity of computer reservation systems;
Whereas it is desirable that detailed marketing, booking and sales data shall be made available to participating carriers on a non-discriminatory basis and with equal timeliness; whereas identification or personal information on a passenger or a corporate user must remain private; whereas, therefore, a system vendor has to ensure by technical means and appropriate safeguards, at least regarding software, that no unauthorized access to information can take place;
Whereas the system vendor should ensure that the principles of technical compliance with the provisions concerning equal functionality and data security are monitored by an independent auditor,
Regulation (EEC) No 2299/89 is hereby amended as follows:

- rights or contracts which confer a decisive influence on the composition, voting or decisions of the bodies of an undertaking or otherwise confer a decisive influence on the running of the business of the undertaking;
(m) "consumer" means any person seeking information about and/or intending to purchase an air transport product;
(p) "service enhancement" means any product or service offered by a system vendor on its own behalf to subscribers in conjunction with a CRS, other than distribution facilities.
- require the acceptance of supplementary conditions which, by their nature or according to commercial usage, have no connection with participation in its CRS and shall apply the same conditions for the same level of service.
In such a case a system vendor shall be entitled to recover more than the costs directly related to the termination of the contract.
'Article 3a

(a) information concerning individual bookings shall be provided on an equal basis and only to the air carrier(s) participating in the service covered by and to the subscriber(s) involved in the booking;
(ii) such data may and, on request, shall cover all participating carriers and/or subscribers, but shall include no identification of or personal information on a passenger or a corporate user;
3. A system vendor shall ensure that the provisions in paragraphs 1 and 2 above are complied with, by technical means and/or appropriate safeguards regarding at least software, in such a way that information provided by or created for air carriers can in no way be accessed by one or more of the parent carriers except as permitted by this Article.
6. In Article 7, paragraphs 1 and 2 are replaced as follows:
'5. (a) In cases where serious discrimination within the meaning of paragraph 1 or 2 is found to exist, the Commission may by decision instruct CRSs to modify their operations approximately in order to terminate such discrimination. The Commission shall immediately inform Member States of such a decision.
2. A parent carrier shall neither directly nor indirectly require use of any specific CRS by a subscriber for sale or issue of tickets for any air transport products provided either directly or indirectly by itself.
'4. (a) A system vendor shall not attach unreasonable conditions to any subscriber contract allowing for the use of its CRS and, in particular, a subscriber may terminate its contract with a system vendor by giving notice which need not exceed three months, to expire not before the end of the first year.
5. A system vendor shall provide in each subscriber contract for:
6. A system vendor shall not impose an obligation on a subscriber to accept an offer of technical equipment or software, but may require that equipment and software used be compatible with its own system.'

The provisions in Article 5, Article 9 (5) and the Annex to this Regulation shall not apply to a CRS used by an air carrier or a group of air carriers in its (their) own office(s) and sales counters clearly identified as such.'
1. The system vendor shall ensure that the technical compliance of its CRS with Articles 4a and 6 is monitored by an independent auditor. For this purpose, the auditor shall be granted access at any time to any programs, procedures, operations and safeguards used on the computers or computer systems through which the system vendor is providing its distribution facilities. Each system vendor shall submit its auditor's report on his inspection and findings to the Commission at least once a year. This report shall be examined by the Commission with a view to any necessary action in accordance with Article 11 (1).
'Article 22
14. Article 23 is replaced by the following:

COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 96/22/EC of 29 April 1996 concerning the prohibition on the use in stockfarming of certain substances having a hormonal or thyrostatic action and of beta-agonists, and repealing Directives 81/602/EEC, 88/146/EEC and 88/299/EEC
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),
(1) Whereas Directive 81/602/EEC (4) prohibits certain substances having a hormonal action and any substances having a thyrostatic action and whereas Directive 88/146/EEC (5) prohibits the use in stockfarming of certain substances having a hormonal action, whilst conceding derogations;
(4) Whereas new substances having an anabolizing action such as beta-agonists are used illegally in livestock-rearing with a view to stimulating the growth and yield of animals;
(7) Whereas, however, the administering of medicinal products based on beta-agonists may be authorized for well-defined therapeutic purposes, in the case of certain categories of bovine animals, equidae and pets;
(10) Whereas withdrawal periods are not harmonized at Community level and there are considerable differences between Member States, particularly as regards authorized veterinary medicinal products containing hormonal substances or beta-agonists; whereas, in the interests of harmonization, maximum withdrawal periods should therefore be set for such medicinal products;
(13) Whereas provision should be made for the effective verification of application of the provisions deriving from this Directive;
(16) Whereas, on 18 January 1996, the European Parliament asked the Commission and the Council to continue opposing the importation into the Community of meat treated with hormones, requested the maintenance of the total ban on the use of growth promoters in stockfarming and, to that end, asked the Council to adopt without delay the Commission proposal on which the European Parliament had delivered its opinion on 19 April 1994,
1. For the purposes of this Directive, the definitions of meat and meat products given in Directives 64/433/EEC (7), 71/118/EEC (8), 77/99/EEC (9), and 91/495/EEC (10), the definitions of aquaculture products given in Directive 91/493/EEC (11) and the definitions of veterinary medicinal products given in Directives 81/851/EEC (12) and 81/852/EEC (13) shall apply.
(b) 'therapeutic treatment` shall mean the administering - under Article 4 of this Directive - to an individual farm animal of an authorized substance to treat, after examination by a veterinarian, a fertility problem - including the termination of unwanted gestation - and, in the case of beta-agonists, to induce tocolysis in cows when calving and to treat respiratory problems and to induce tocolysis in equidae raised for purposes other than meat production;
(ii) in the case of aquaculture animals, to a group of breeding animals for sex inversion, on a veterinarian's prescription and under his responsibility;

Notwithstanding Article 3 (a) and without prejudice to Article 2, Member States may authorize the administering to farm animals, for the purpose of zootechnical treatment, of veterinary medicinal products having an oestrogenic, androgenic or gestagenic action which are authorized in accordance with Directives 81/851/EEC and 81/852/EEC. Such veterinary medicinal products must be administered by a veterinarian to clearly identified animals; the treatment must be recorded by the veterinarian responsible in accordance with point 1 of Article 4.
In the cases provided for in this Article, the veterinarian shall make out a non-renewable prescription, specifying the treatment in question and the quantity of the product required and shall record the products prescribed.
1. Hormonal products and beta-agonists the administration of which to farm animals is authorized in accordance with Articles 4 and 5 must meet the requirements of Directives 81/851/EEC and 81/852/EEC.
(i) products acting as a deposit;
- which were authorized under rules that preceded the amendment made by Regulation (EEC) No 2309/93 (14),
(b) veterinary medicinal products containing beta-agonists which have a withdrawal period of more than 28 days after the end of treatment.
However, trade in high-value horses, and in particular racehorses, competition horses, circus horses or horses intended for stud purposes or for exhibitions, including registered equidae to which veterinary medicinal products containing allyl trenbolone or beta-agonists have been administered for the purposes referred to in Article 4, may take place before the end of the withdrawal period, provided that the conditions governing administration are fulfilled and that the type and date of treatment are entered on the certificate or passport accompanying these animals.
Member States shall ensure that:
(a) the possession or presence of substances or products prohibited under Article 2, intended to be administered to animals for the purpose of fattening;
(d) failure to observe the restrictions on the use of certain substances or products laid down in Articles 4 and 5;

COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 96/42/EC of 25 June 1996 amending Directive 77/388/EEC on the common system of value added tax
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas Article 12 (3) (d) of Directive 77/388/EEC (3) lays down that the rules concerning the taxation of agricultural outputs other than those falling within category 1 of Annex H are to be decided unanimously by the Council before 31 December 1994 on a proposal from the Commission; whereas, until that date, those Member States which had already been applying a reduced rate might continue to do so while those applying a standard rate could not apply a reduced rate; whereas that allowed a two-year postponement in the application of the standard rate;
HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:
1. Article 12 (3) (d) shall be deleted;
Article 2
This Directive shall apply from 1 January 1995.
DIRECTIVE 96/57/EC OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 3 September 1996 on energy efficiency requirements for household electric refrigerators, freezers and combinations thereof
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),
(1) Whereas it is important to promote measures aimed at the proper functioning of the internal market;
(4) Whereas some Member States are on the point of adopting provisions relating to the efficiency of household refrigerators and freezers, which might create barriers to trade in these products in the Community;
(7) Whereas, moreover, Article 130r of the Treaty calls for the protection and improvement of the environment and the prudent and rational utilization of natural resources, these two objectives being among those of the Community policy on the environment; whereas electricity generation and consumption account for 30 % of man-made carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and some 35 % of primary energy consumption in the Community; whereas these percentages are increasing;
(10) Whereas Decision 91/565/EEC (6) established a programme to promote energy efficiency in the Community (the SAVE programme);
(13) Whereas Directive 92/75/EEC (7) (the framework Directive) and Commission Directive 94/2/EC (8) (the Directive implementing Directive 92/75/EEC), which require the compulsory labelling of appliances and an indication in other forms of the energy consumption, will increase consumers' awareness of the energy efficiency of household refrigeration appliances; whereas this measure will therefore also encourage the various competitors to offer levels of energy efficiency for their appliances higher than the standards required by this Directive; whereas, however, the provision of information to consumers must nevertheless be accompanied by an indication of the standards in order to achieve full benefit and lead to a real improvement in the total average efficiency of the appliances sold;
(16) Whereas regard should be had to Council Decision 93/465/EEC of 22 July 1993 concerning the modules for the various phases of the conformity assessment procedures and the rules for the affixing and use of the CE conformity marking (10), which are intended to be used in the technical harmonization directives;
(19) Whereas this Directive is confined to household refrigeration appliances for foodstuffs, supplied by mains electricity, excluding those manufactured on a one-off basis; whereas refrigeration equipment for commercial use is much more varied and not appropriate for inclusion in this Directive,
This Directive shall apply to new electric mains-operated household refrigerators, frozen food storage cabinets, food freezers, and combinations of these as defined in Annex I and referred to hereafter as 'refrigeration appliances`. Appliances which can also use other energy sources, particularly accumulators, and household refrigeration appliances working on the absorption principle and appliances manufactured on a one-off basis shall be excluded.
2. The manufacturer of a refrigeration appliance covered by this Directive, his authorized representative established in the Community or the person responsible for placing the appliance on the Community market shall be responsible for ensuring that each appliance placed on the market conforms with the requirement referred to in paragraph 1.
2. Unless they have evidence to the contrary, Member States shall presume that refrigeration appliances bearing the 'CE` marking required under Article 5 comply with all the provisions of this Directive.
Article 4
1. When appliances are placed on the market, they must bear the 'CE` marking, which shall consist of the initials 'CE`. The form of the marking to be used is shown in Annex III. The 'CE` marking shall be affixed visibly, legibly and indelibly to refrigeration appliances and, where appropriate, to the packaging.
1. Where a Member State establishes that the 'CE` marking has been affixed improperly, the manufacturer or his authorized representative established within the Community shall be obliged to bring the product into conformity and to end the infringement in accordance with conditions imposed by the Member State. Where neither the manufacturer nor his authorized representative is established within the Community, the person who places the refrigeration appliance on the Community market shall undertake these obligations.
1. Any decision taken pursuant to this Directive which contains a restriction on the placing on the market of refrigeration appliances shall state the precise grounds on which it is based. The party concerned shall be notified without delay of the decision and shall be informed at the same time of the possibilities and time limits regarding the legal remedies available to it under the laws in force in the Member State in question.
Before the expiry of a period of four years from the adoption of this Directive, the Commission shall make an assessment of the results obtained as compared with those expected. With a view to advancing to a second stage in energy efficiency improvement, the Commission shall then consider, in consultation with the interested parties, the need to lay down a second set of appropriate measures for significantly improving the energy efficiency of household refrigeration appliances. In that case, each energy efficiency measure and the date of its entry into force will be based on energy efficiency levels which can be economically and technically justified in the light of the circumstances at the time. Any other measure judged appropriate to improve the efficiency of household refrigeration appliances shall also be considered.
Member States shall apply these provisions on the expiry of a period of three years counting from the date of adoption of this Directive.
3. During a three-year period following adoption of this Directive, Member States shall permit the placing on the market of refrigeration appliances which comply with the same conditions as those which were applied on their territory at the date of adoption of this Directive.

Article 9
COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 96/75/EC of 19 November 1996 on the systems of chartering and pricing in national and international inland waterway transport in the Community
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),
Whereas the growing problems of road and rail saturation, transport safety, environment, energy saving and quality of life of the citizen call, in the public interest, for greater development and better use of the transport potential offered by inland waterway, in particular by improving its competitiveness;
Whereas, to this end provision should be made for a transitional period, the scope of the rotation system being gradually limited for carriers to adapt to the conditions of a free market and, where appropriate, to set up trade groupings better suited to the logistical needs of shippers;
HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:
(a) 'system of chartering by rotation` shall mean a system which consists of allocating in a charter exchange requests for transport operations, at previously fixed prices and under conditions made known, from customers on the basis of the order in which vessels become available after unloading. Carriers are asked, in the order of their registration on the rota, to choose in turn a load from those on offer. Those who make no choice nonetheless keep their position in the order;
(d) 'serious market disturbance` shall mean the emergence, in the inland waterway transport market, of problems specific to that market likely to cause a serious and potentially persistent excess of supply over demand, thereby posing a serious threat to the financial stability and survival of a large number of inland waterway carriers, unless the short and medium-term forecasts for the market in question indicate substantial and lasting improvements.
Article 3
- the rotation and pricing systems imposed are freely accessible under the same conditions to all Member States' carriers.
(a) oil and gas, liquid cargo and dry bulk freight, special cargoes such as heavy and indivisible loads, container transport, transport within port areas, any kind of own-account transport and any type of transport operation already outside the system of chartering by rotation;
- combined transport, namely intermodal transport where the routes are principally by inland waterway and the initial and/or terminal legs (as short as possible) are by road or rail.
- by providing shippers with the opportunity of concluding contracts for multiple trips, i.e. a series of successive trips using the same vessel,
Within a period of two years from the entry into force of this Directive, Member States involved in systems of chartering by rotation shall take the necessary measures to enable shippers to have a free choice between three types of contract:
- contracts for single or multiple trips.
2. In the event of a request from a Member State for suitable measures, a decision shall be taken within a period of three months from receipt of the request.
- the rate of utilization of the hold,
4. Decisions taken pursuant to this Article, which may not exceed the duration of the disturbance in the market, shall be notified immediately to the Member States.
2. The representative of the Commission shall submit to the Committee a draft of the measures to be taken. The Committee shall deliver its opinion on the draft, where necessary by vote, within a time limit which the Chairman may lay down according to the urgency of the matter.
Article 9
2. Member States shall forthwith communicate to the Commission the text of the provisions of national law which they adopt in the field covered by this Directive.

(4) Whereas the Council has a wide discretion regarding the choice of the most appropriate measures for attaining the objective of Article 51 of the Treaty; and whereas the system of coordination provided for in Regulations (EEC) No 1408/71 and (EEC) No 574/72, and in particular the rules of aggregation, are not appropriate to supplementary pension schemes, except for schemes which are covered by the term 'legislation` as defined by the first subparagraph of Article 1(j) of Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 or in respect of which a Member State makes a declaration under that Article, and should therefore be subject to specific measures, of which this Directive is the first, in order to take account of their special nature and characteristics and the diversity of such schemes within and between Member States;
(7) Whereas a contribution to this objective can be made if workers who move or whose place of employment moves from one Member State to another are guaranteed equal treatment as regards the protection of their supplementary pension rights with workers who remain or whose place of employment changes but remains within the same Member State;
(10) Whereas, in order to enable the right of free movement to be exercised effectively, workers and others holding entitlement should have certain guarantees for equal treatment regarding the preservation of their vested pension rights deriving from supplementary pension schemes;
(13) Whereas in this regard the Treaty requires not only the abolition of any discrimination based on nationality between workers of the Member States but also the elimination of any national measure likely to impede or render less attractive for those workers the exercise of the fundamental freedoms guaranteed by the Treaty as interpreted by the Court of Justice of the European Communities in successive judgments;
(16) Whereas, by reason of the diversity of supplementary social security schemes, the Community should lay down only a general framework of objectives and therefore a Directive is the appropriate legal instrument;
CHAPTER I
The aim of this Directive is to protect the rights of members of supplementary pension schemes who move from one Member State to another, thereby contributing to the removal of obstacles to the free movement of employed and self-employed persons within the Community. Such protection refers to pension rights under both voluntary and compulsory supplementary pension schemes, with the exception of schemes covered by Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71.
CHAPTER II
For the purpose of this Directive:
(c) 'pension rights` means any benefits to which scheme members and others holding entitlement are entitled under the rules of a supplementary pension scheme and, where applicable, under national legislation;
(f) 'contribution` means any payment made or deemed to have been made to a supplementary pension scheme.
Article 4
Article 5
Article 6
2. Where, pursuant to paragraph 1, contributions continue to be made to a supplementary pension scheme in one Member State, the posted worker and, where applicable, his employer shall be exempted from any obligation to make contributions to a supplementary pension scheme in another Member State.
Member States shall take measures to ensure that employers, trustees or others responsible for the management of supplementary pension schemes provide adequate information to scheme members, when they move to another Member State, as to their pension rights and the choices which are available to them under the scheme. Such information shall at least correspond to information given to scheme members in respect of whom contributions cease to be made but who remain within the same Member State.
Article 8
Member States shall introduce into their national legal systems such measures as are necessary to enable all persons who consider themselves wronged by failure to apply the provisions of this Directive to pursue their claims by judicial process after possible recourse to other competent authorities.
When Member States adopt these provisions, these shall contain a reference to this Directive or shall be accompanied by such reference at the time of their official publication. The procedure for such reference shall be adopted by Member States.
3. On the basis of the information supplied by Member States, the Commission shall submit a report to the European Parliament, the Council and the Economic and Social Committee, within six years of the entry into force of this Directive.
COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 98/57/EC of 20 July 1998 on the control of Ralstonia solanacearum (Smith) Yabuuchi et al.
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),
Whereas the harmful organism Ralstonia solanacearum (Smith) Yabuuchi et al. was previously known as Pseudomonas solanacearum (Smith) Smith; whereas Ralstonia solanacearum (Smith) Yabuuchi et al. is likely to become the generally accepted name for the organism; whereas the present Directive should take account of this scientific development;
Whereas protective measures to prevent the introduction of harmful organisms into the territory of a Member State would have only a limited effect if such organisms were not controlled simultaneously and methodically throughout the Community and were not prevented from spreading;
Whereas, in order to ensure this, certain measures must be taken within the Community; whereas Member States must, in addition, be able to take additional or stricter measures where necessary, provided that there is no hindrance to the movement of potatoes or tomatoes within the Community, except insofar as laid down in Council Directive 77/93/EEC of 21 December 1976 on protective measures against the introduction into the Community of organisms harmful to plants or plant products and against their spread within the Community (4); whereas such measures must be notified to the other Member States and to the Commission;
Whereas the current knowledge of the biology and epidemiology of Ralstonia solanacearum (Smith) Yabuuchi et al. under European conditions is incomplete and it is anticipated that a review of the measures proposed will be necessary within several seasons; similarly improvements to the test procedure are anticipated in the light of further research especially on the sensitivity and specificity of test methods in order to select and standardise the optimum test methods available;
Article 1
(b) prevent its occurrence and spread; and
1. Member States shall conduct annual systematic official surveys for the organism on the listed plant material originating in their territory. In order to identify other possible sources of contamination threatening the production of the listed plant material, Member States shall carry out a risk assessment and, unless no risk of spread of the organism has been identified during that assessment, they shall, in production areas of the listed plant material, conduct targeted official surveys for the organism on plants other than the listed plant material, including wild solanaceous host plants, as well as on surface water which is used for irrigation or spraying of listed plant material and on liquid waste discharged from industrial processing or packaging premises handling listed plant material and used for irrigation or spraying of listed plant material. The extent of these targeted surveys shall be determined according to the risk identified. Member States may also conduct official surveys for the organism on the material, such as growing medium, soil and solid waste from industrial processing or packaging premises.
(b) for host plants other than the listed plant material, and for water including liquid waste, in accordance with appropriate methods and, where appropriate, samples shall be taken and subjected to official or officially supervised laboratory testing;
3. The details and results of the official surveys provided for in paragraph 1 shall be notified each year to the other Member States and to the Commission in accordance with the provisions of point 2 of Section II, Annex I. These notifications shall be submitted by 1 June except for potatoes use as farm-saved seed for which the notification shall be submitted by 1 September. The details and results for crops shall be related to the previous year's production. The details of these notifications may be submitted to the Committee.
5. The following provisions may be adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 16a of Directive 77/93/EEC:
Article 3
1. In each case of suspected occurrence, the responsible official bodies of the Member State(s) concerned shall ensure completion of official or officially supervised laboratory testing using, for the listed plant material, the relevant method set out in Annex II and in accordance with the conditions specified in point 1 of Annex III, or, in all other cases, any other officially approved method, in order to confirm or refute the suspected occurrence. In the case of confirmation, the requirements laid down in point 2 of Annex III shall apply.
(a) prohibit the movement of plants and tubers from all crops, lots or consignments from which the samples have been taken, except under their control and provided that it has been established that there is no identifiable risk of the organism spreading;
3. In those cases of suspected occurrence where there is a risk of contamination of the listed plant material or surface water from or into another Member State(s), the Member State in which the suspected occurrence has been reported shall immediately notify, according to the risk identified, the details of the said suspected occurrence to the other Member State(s) concerned, and there whall be appropriate cooperation between the said Member States. The Member State(s) so notified shall introduce precautionary measures in accordance with paragraph 2(c) and take any further action, as appropriate, in accordance with paragraphs 1 and 2.
Article 5
(i) establish an investigation to determine the extent and primary source(s) of the contamination in accordance with the provisions of Annex IV, with further testing in accordance with Article 4(1), on, at least, all clonally related seed potato stocks, and,
(iv) demarcate a zone on the basis of the designation of contamination under point (ii), the determination of the extent of probable contamination under point (iii), and the possible spread of the organism, in accordance with the provisions of point 2(i) of Annex V;
(ii) designate as contaminated the host plants of the organism from which the sample was taken; and
(i) establish an investigation including an official survey at appropriate times on samples of surface water and if present wild solanaceous host plants to establish the extent of the contamination; and
2. Member States shall immediately notify the other Member States and the Commission, in accordance with the provisions of point 3 of Annex V, of any contamination designated under paragraphs 1(a)(ii) and 1(c)(ii) and the details of the zone demarcation under paragraph 1(a)(iv) and, where applicable, under paragraph 1(c)(iii). The details of the notification under this paragraph may be submitted to the Committee.

3. Member States shall prescribe that any machinery, vehicle, vessel, store, or units thereof, and any other objects including packaging material, designated as contaminated under Article 5(1)(a)(ii) or determined as probably contaminated under Article 5(1)(a)(iii) and (c)(iii), shall either be destroyed or decontaminated using appropriate methods as specified in point 3 of Annex VI. After decontamination, any such objects shall no longer be considered contaminated.
1. Member States shall prescribe that seed potatoes shall meet the requirements of Directive 77/93/EEC and shall derive in direct line from potato material obtained under an officially approved programme which has been found free of the organism in official or officially supervised testing using the relevant method set out in Annex II.
(i) by testing of the earlier propagations, including the initial clonal selection and systematic testing of basic seed potato clones; or
2. The following provisions may be adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 16a of Directive 77/93/EEC:
Article 8
Without prejudice to the provisions of Directive 77/93/EEC, Member States may authorise derogations from the measures referred to in Articles 6 and 8 of this Directive in accordance with the provisions laid down in Directive 95/44/EC (5) for trial or scientific purposes, and for work on varietal selections.
Amendments to the Annexes to this Directive, to be made in the light of developments in scientific or technical knowledge, shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 16a of Directive 77/93/EEC.

COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 98/93/EC of 14 December 1998 amending Directive 68/414/EEC imposing an obligation on Member States of the EEC to maintain minimum stocks of crude oil and/or petroleum products
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),
(1) Whereas the Council adopted Directive 68/414/EEC of 20 December 1968 imposing an obligation on Member States of the European Economic Community to maintain minimum stocks of crude oil and/or petroleum products (4);
(4) Whereas it is important that the security of oil supply is enhanced;
(7) Whereas, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity and in accordance with the principle of proportionality as stipulated in Article 3b of the Treaty, the objective of maintaining a high level of security of oil supply in the Community through reliable and transparent mechanisms based on solidarity amongst Member States and, at the same time, complying with the rules of the internal market and competition, can be carried out more adequately at the level of the Community; whereas this Directive does not exceed what is necessary to achieve this objective;
(10) Whereas it is appropriate that organisational arrangements for the maintenance of stocks are transparent, ensuring a fair and non-discriminatory sharing of the burden of the stock-holding obligation; whereas, therefore, information relating to the cost of holding oil stocks may be made available by Member States to interested parties;
(13) Whereas it is appropriate to adopt approaches which are already followed by the Community and the Member States within their international obligations and agreements; whereas, owing to changes in the pattern of oil consumption, international aviation bunkers have become an important component of this consumption;
(16) Whereas it is desirable, in order to ensure the smooth running of the internal market, to promote the use of agreements between Member States concerning minimum stockholding in order to further the use of storage facilities in other Member States; whereas it is for the Member States concerned to take the decision to conclude such agreements;
(19) Whereas it is appropriate to inform the Council on a regular basis on the situation concerning security stocks in the Community,
Directive 68/414/EEC is hereby amended as follows:
3. the existing Article 3 shall become Article 2 and shall be supplemented by the following paragraph:

'2. For the purposes of implementing this Directive, stocks may be established, under agreements between Governments, within the territory of a Member State for the account of undertakings, or bodies/entities, established in another Member State. It is for the Government of the Member State concerned to decide whether to hold a part of its stocks outside its national territory.
Drafts of the agreements mentioned in the first subparagraph shall be sent to the Commission, which may make its comments known to the Governments concerned. The agreements, once concluded, shall be notified to the Commission, which shall make them known to the other Member States.
- they must lay down conditions and arrangements for the maintenance of stocks with the aim of safeguarding control and availability of these stocks,
- they must state that, where provision is made for unilateral termination, the latter shall not operate in the event of a supply crisis and that, in any event, the Commission shall receive prior information of any termination.
- the minimum period of such a contract must be 90 days,
- the undertaking, or body/entity, holding the stocks at the disposal of the beneficiary undertaking, or body/entity, must be one which is subject to the jurisdiction of the Member State on whose territory the stocks are situated insofar as the legal powers of that Member State to control and verify the existence of the stocks are concerned.`;(c) Paragraph 3, second subparagraph, shall be replaced by the following:
Member States shall adopt all the necessary provisions and take all the necessary measures to ensure control and supervision of stocks. They shall put in place mechanisms to verify the stocks according to the provisions of this Directive.`

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Whereas, in accordance with Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90, maximum residue limits must be established progressively for all pharmacologically active substances which are used within the Community in veterinary medicinal products intended for administration to food-producing animals;
Whereas, for the control of residues, as provided for in appropriate Community legislation, maximum residue limits should usually be established for the target tissues of liver or kidney; whereas, however, the liver and kidney are frequently removed from carcasses moving in international trade, and maximum residue limits should therefore also always be established for muscle or fat tissues;
Whereas lini oleum, folic acid, betain and cefazolin should be inserted into Annex II to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90;

Article 1
2. In Article 2:
(a) ECU 10 per 100 kilograms net in the case of licences where the refund is fixed in advance;

(9) The establishment of a coherent strategy for the prevention of explosions requires that organisational measures complement the technical measures taken at the workplace; Directive 89/391/EEC requires the employer to be in possession of an assessment of the risks to workers' health and safety at work; this requirement is to be regarded as being specified by this Directive in that it provides that the employer is to draw up an explosion protection document, or set of documents, which satisfies the minimum requirements laid down in this Directive and is to keep it up to date; the explosion protection document includes the identification of the hazards, the evaluation of risks and the definition of the specific measures to be taken to safeguard the health and safety of workers at risk from explosive atmospheres, in accordance with Article 9 of Directive 89/391/EEC; the explosion protection document may be part of the assessment of the risks to health and safety at work required by Article 9 of Directive 89/391/EEC;
(12) Coordination should take place when workers from several undertakings are present at the same workplace;
(15) Directive 94/9/EC divides the equipment and protective systems which it covers into equipment groups and categories; this Directive provides for a classification by the employer of the places where explosive atmospheres may occur in terms of zones and determines which equipment and protective systems groups and categories should be used in each zone,
GENERAL PROVISIONS
1. This Directive, which is the 15th individual Directive within the meaning of Article 16(1) of Directive 89/391/EEC, lays down minimum requirements for the safety and health protection of workers potentially at risk from explosive atmospheres as defined in Article 2.
(b) the use of appliances burning gaseous fuels in accordance with Directive 90/396/EEC(7);
(e) the use of means of transport by land, water and air, to which the pertinent provisions of the international agreements (e.g. ADNR, ADR, ICAO, IMO, RID), and the Community Directives giving effect to those agreements, apply. Means of transport intended for use in a potentially explosive atmosphere shall not be excluded.

(3) Whereas the "Guidance" section of the Fund should finance expenditure for certain rural development measures in regions whose development is lagging behind as well as for the rural development Community initiative;
(6) Whereas, during the clearance of accounts, the Commission is able to determine within a reasonable time the total expenditure to be entered against the Guarantee Section in the general account only if it has satisfactory assurance that the national controls are adequate and transparent and that the paying agencies verify the legality and regularity of the payment requests which they execute; whereas provision should therefore be made for the accreditation of paying agencies by Member States; whereas in order to ensure consistency in the standards required for accreditation in the Member States the Commission provides guidance on the criteria to be applied; whereas, for that purpose, it should be stipulated that only expenditure effected by paying agencies accredited by the Member States should be financed; whereas, moreover, in order to ensure the transparency of national controls, in particular as regards authorisation, validation and payment procedures, the number of authorities and bodies to which these responsibilities are delegated should, where appropriate, be restricted taking account of the constitutional arrangements of each Member State;
(9) Whereas two types of decisions should be established, one concerning the clearance of the Guarantee Section of the Fund, the other determining the consequences, including financial corrections, to be drawn from the results of the checks on conformity, with Community rules, of the expenditures;

(15) Whereas, with a view to simplifying financial management, it is desirable to bring the financing period of the Fund closer to the financial year as set out in Article 272(1) of the Treaty; whereas carrying out such an operation requires having a clear picture of the funds currently available towards the end of the financial year concerned; whereas, therefore, provision should be made for the Commission to have the powers necessary to adapt the financing period of the Fund where there are enough remaining budgetary resources available;
It shall comprise two sections:
2. The Guarantee Section shall finance:

Advances shall be paid to the Member State not later than the third working day of the second month following that in which the expenditure is effected.
The clearance of accounts decision shall cover the integrality, accuracy and veracity of the accounts submitted. The decision shall not prejudice the adoption of a subsequent decision pursuant to paragraph 4.
If no agreement is reached, the Member State may ask for a procedure to be initiated with a view to mediating between the respective positions within a period of four months, the results of which shall be set out in a report sent to and examined by the Commission, before a decision to refuse financing is taken.
(a) expenditure referred to in Article 2 effected prior to 24 months preceding the Commission's written communication of the results of those checks to the Member State concerned;

Article 2
(a) theft or other unlawful appropriation of a payment instrument;
(d) fraudulent use of a stolen or otherwise unlawfully appropriated, or of a counterfeited or falsified payment instrument;
Each Member State shall take the necessary measures to ensure that the following conduct is a criminal offence when committed intentionally:
Article 4

Article 5
Article 6
Article 7
- a power of representation of the legal person, or

Entry into force
of 21 January 2002
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 47(2) thereof,
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty(3),
(2) Taking into account market developments, it is desirable that the investment objective of UCITS be widened in order to permit them to invest in financial instruments, other than transferable securities, which are sufficiently liquid. The financial instruments which are eligible to be investment assets of the portfolio of the UCITS are listed in this Directive. The selection of investments for a portfolio by means of an index is a management technique.
(5) It is useful to ensure that the concept of regulated market in this Directive corresponds to that in Council Directive 93/22/EEC of 10 May 1993 on investment services in the securities field(5).
(8) To take market developments into account and in consideration of the completion of economic and monetary union it is desirable to permit UCITS to invest in bank deposits. To ensure adequate liquidity of investments in deposits, these deposits are to be repayable on demand or have the right to be withdrawn. If the deposits are made with a credit institution the registered office of which is located in a non-Member State, the credit institution should be subject to prudential rules equivalent to those laid down in Community legislation.
(11) UCITS should be explicitly permitted, as part of their general investment policy and/or for hedging purposes in order to reach a set financial target or the risk profile indicated in the prospectus, to invest in financial derivative instruments. In order to ensure investor protection, it is necessary to limit the maximum potential exposure relating to derivative instruments so that it does not exceed the total net value of the UCITS's portfolio. In order to ensure constant awareness of the risks and commitments arising from derivative transactions and to check compliance with investment limits, these risks and commitments will have to be measured and monitored on an ongoing basis. Finally, in order to ensure investor protection through disclosure, UCITS should describe their strategies, techniques and investment limits governing their derivative operations.
(14) Some portfolio management techniques for collective investment undertakings investing primarily in shares and/or debt securities are based on the replication of stock indices and/or debt-security indices. It is desirable to permit UCITS to replicate well-known and recognised stock indices and/or debt-security indices. It may therefore be necessary to introduce more flexible risk-spreading rules for UCITS investing in shares and/or debt securities to this end.
(17) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Directive should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(6).
Article 1
2. in Article 1 the following paragraphs shall be added: "8. For the purposes of this Directive, 'transferable securities' shall mean:
- any other negotiable securities which carry the right to acquire any such transferable securities by subscription or exchange,
3. Article 19(1)(a) shall be replaced by the following: "(a) transferable securities and money market instruments admitted to or dealt in on a regulated market within the meaning of Article 1(13) of the ISD, and/or";
- the terms "and/or" shall be added to the end of point (d),
- the level of protection for unit-holders in the other collective investment undertakings is equivalent to that provided for unit-holders in a UCITS, and in particular that the rules on assets segregation, borrowing, lending, and uncovered sales of transferable securities and money market instruments are equivalent to the requirements of this Directive,
(f) deposits with credit institutions which are repayable on demand or have the right to be withdrawn, and maturing in no more than 12 months, provided that the credit institution has its registered office in a Member State or, if the registered office of the credit institution is situated in a non-Member State, provided that it is subject to prudential rules considered by the UCITS' competent authorities as equivalent to those laid down in Community law, and/or
- the counterparties to OTC derivative transactions are institutions subject to prudential supervision, and belonging to the categories approved by the UCITS' competent authorities, and
- issued or guaranteed by a central, regional or local authority or central bank of a Member State, the European Central Bank, the European Union or the European Investment Bank, a non-Member State or, in the case of a Federal State, by one of the members making up the federation, or by a public international body to which one or more Member States belong, or
- issued by other bodies belonging to the categories approved by the UCITS' competent authorities provided that investments in such instruments are subject to investor protection equivalent to that laid down in the first, the second or the third indent and provided that the issuer is a company whose capital and reserves amount to at least EUR 10 million and which presents and publishes its annual accounts in accordance with Directive 78/660/EEC(7), is an entity which, within a group of companies which includes one or several listed companies, is dedicated to the financing of the group or is an entity which is dedicated to the financing of securitisation vehicles which benefit from a banking liquidity line.";
8. Article 20 shall be deleted;
2. The Member States may authorise UCITS to employ techniques and instruments relating to transferable securities and money market instruments under the conditions and within the limits which they lay down provided that such techniques and instruments are used for the purpose of efficient portfolio management. When these operations concern the use of derivative instruments, these conditions and limits shall conform to the provisions laid down in this Directive.
The exposure is calculated taking into account the current value of the underlying assets, the counterparty risk, future market movements and the time available to liquidate the positions. This shall also apply to the following subparagraphs.
4. The Member States shall send the Commission full information and any subsequent changes in their regulation concerning the methods used to calculate the risk exposures mentioned in paragraph 3, including the risk exposure to a counterparty in OTC derivative transactions, no later than 13 February 2004. The Commission shall forward that information to the other Member States. Such information will be the subject of exchanges of views within the Contact Committee in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 53(4).";
The risk exposure to a counterparty of the UCITS in an OTC derivative transaction may not exceed:
2. Member States may raise the 5 % limit laid down in the first sentence of paragraph 1 to a maximum of 10 %. However, the total value of the transferable securities and the money market instruments held by the UCITS in the issuing bodies in each of which it invests more than 5 % of its assets must not then exceed 40 % of the value of its assets. This limitation does not apply to deposits and OTC derivative transactions made with financial institutions subject to prudential supervision.
- deposits made with, and/or
The Member States shall send the Commission a list of the aforementioned categories of bonds together with the categories of issuers authorised, in accordance with the laws and supervisory arrangements mentioned in the first subparagraph, to issue bonds complying with the criteria set out above. A notice specifying the status of the guarantees offered shall be attached to these lists. The Commission shall immediately forward that information to the other Member States together with any comments which it considers appropriate, and shall make the information available to the public. Such communications may be the subject of exchanges of views within the Contact Committee in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 53(4).
Companies which are included in the same group for the purposes of consolidated accounts, as defined in accordance with Directive 83/349/EEC(8) or in accordance with recognised international accounting rules, are regarded as a single body for the purpose of calculating the limits contained in this Article.
1. Without prejudice to the limits laid down in Article 25, the Member States may raise the limits laid down in Article 22 to a maximum of 20 % for investment in shares and/or debt securities issued by the same body when, according to the fund rules or instruments of incorporation, the aim of the UCITS' investment policy is to replicate the composition of a certain stock or debt securities index which is recognised by the competent authorities, on the following basis:
- it is published in an appropriate manner.
13. Article 24 shall be replaced by the following: "Article 24
The Member States may allow that, when a UCITS has acquired units of UCITS and/or other collective investment undertakings, the assets of the respective UCITS or other collective investment undertakings do not have to be combined for the purposes of the limits laid down in Article 22.
14. the following Article shall be inserted: "Article 24a
3. When the net asset value of a UCITS is likely to have a high volatility due to its portfolio composition or the portfolio management techniques that may be used, its prospectus and, where necessary, any other promotional literature must include a prominent statement drawing attention to this characteristic.
1. the third indent shall be replaced by the following: "- 25 % of the units of any single UCITS and/or other collective investment undertaking within the meaning of the first and second indent of Article 1(2),";
17. in Article 25(3)(a), (b) and (c) the words "and money market instruments" shall be added after the words "transferable securities";
While ensuring observance of the principle of risk spreading, the Member States may allow recently authorised UCITS to derogate from Articles 22, 22a, 23 and 24 for six months following the date of their authorisation.";
1. In addition to its functions provided for in Article 53(1), the Contact Committee may also meet as a Regulatory Committee within the meaning of Article 5 of Decision 1999/468/EC(9) to assist the Commission in regard to the technical modifications to be made to this Directive in the following areas:
2. Where reference is made to this paragraph, Articles 5 and 7 of Decision 1999/468/EC shall apply, having regard to the provisions of Article 8 thereof.
Article 2
(b) review the scope of the Directive in terms of how it applies to different types of products (e.g. institutional funds, real-estate funds, master-feeder funds and hedge funds); the study should in particular focus on the size of the market for such funds, the regulation, where applicable, of these funds in the Member States and an evaluation of the need for further harmonisation of these funds;
(e) analyse the competitive situation between funds managed by management companies and "self-managed" investment companies.
Article 3
When Member States adopt these measures they shall contain a reference to this Directive or shall be accompanied by such reference on the occasion of their official publication. The methods of making such a reference shall be laid down by the Member States.
Article 5
of 12 January 2001
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having consulted the Advisory Committee on State Aid,
(2) Regulation (EC) No 994/98 also empowers the Commission to declare, in accordance with Article 87 of the Treaty, that aid that complies with the map approved by the Commission for each Member State for the grant of regional aid is compatible with the common market and is not subject to the notification requirement of Article 88(3) of the Treaty.
(5) Small and medium-sized enterprises play a decisive role in job creation and, more generally, act as a factor of social stability and economic drive. However, their development may be limited by market imperfections. They often have difficulties in obtaining capital or credit, given the risk-shy nature of certain financial markets and the limited guarantees that they may be able to offer. Their limited resources may also restrict their access to information, notably regarding new technology and potential markets. Having regard to those considerations, the purpose of the aid exempted by this Regulation should be to facilitate the development of the economic activities of small and medium-sized enterprises, provided that such aid does not adversely affect trading conditions to an extent contrary to the common interest.
(8) In order to eliminate differences that might give rise to distortions of competition, in order to facilitate coordination between different Community and national initiatives concerning small and medium-sized enterprises, and for reasons of administrative clarity and legal certainty, the definition of "small and medium-sized enterprises" used in this Regulation should be that laid down in Commission Recommendation 96/280/EC of 3 April 1996 concerning the definition of small and medium-sized enterprises(5). That definition was also used in the Community guidelines on State aid for small and medium-sized enterprises(6).
(11) Having regard to the differences between small enterprises and medium-sized enterprises, different ceilings of aid intensity should be set for small enterprises and for medium-sized enterprises.
(14) This Regulation should exempt aid to small and medium-sized enterprises regardless of location. Investment and job creation can contribute to the economic development of less favoured regions in the Community. Small and medium-sized enterprises in those regions suffer from both the structural disadvantage of the location and the difficulties deriving from their size. It is therefore appropriate that small and medium-sized enterprises in assisted regions should benefit from higher ceilings.
(17) Having regard to the need to strike the appropriate balance between minimising distortions of competition in the aided sector and the objectives of this Regulation, it should not exempt individual aid grants which exceed a fixed maximum amount, whether or not made under an aid scheme exempted by this Regulation.
(20) In order to ensure transparency and effective monitoring, in accordance with Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 994/98, it is appropriate to establish a standard format in which Member States should provide the Commission with summary information whenever, in pursuance of this Regulation, an aid scheme is implemented or an individual aid outside such schemes is granted, with a view to publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities. For the same reasons, it is appropriate to establish rules concerning the records that Member States should keep regarding the aid exempted by this Regulation. For the purposes of the annual report to be submitted to the Commission by Member States, it is appropriate for the Commission to establish its specific requirements, including, in view of the wide availability of the necessary technology, information in computerised form.
Article 1
2. This Regulation shall not apply:
(c) to aid contingent upon the use of domestic over imported goods.
For the purpose of this Regulation:
(c) "investment in tangible assets" shall mean an investment in fixed physical assets relating to the creation of a new establishment, the extension of an existing establishment, or the engagement in an activity involving a fundamental change in the product or production process of an existing establishment (in particular through rationalisation, diversification or modernisation). An investment in fixed assets undertaken in the form of the takeover of an establishment which has closed or which would have closed had it not been purchased shall also be regarded as tangible investment;
(f) "net aid intensity" shall mean the aid amount net of tax expressed as a percentage of the project's eligible costs;
Conditions for exemption
(a) any aid that could be awarded under such scheme fulfils all the conditions of this Regulation;
Article 4
2. The gross aid intensity shall not exceed:
3. Where the investment takes place in areas which qualify for regional aid, the aid intensity shall not exceed the ceiling of regional investment aid determined in the map approved by the Commission for each Member State by more than:
The higher regional aid ceilings shall only apply if the aid is granted under the condition that the investment is maintained in the recipient region for at least five years and that the beneficiary's contribution to its financing is at least 25 %.
6. In cases where the aid is calculated on the basis of jobs created, the amount of the aid shall be expressed as a percentage of the wage costs over a period of two years relating to the employment created under the following conditions:
(c) the employment created shall be maintained during a minimum period of five years.
Aid to small and medium-sized enterprises that fulfil the following conditions shall be compatible with the common market within the meaning of Article 87(3) of the Treaty and shall be exempt from the notification requirement of Article 88(3) of the Treaty:
Article 6
(a) the total eligible costs of the whole project are at least EUR 25000000 and
(b) the total gross aid amount is at least EUR 15000000.
This Regulation shall only exempt aid if, before work on the aided project is started:
Article 8
2. Aid exempted by this Regulation shall not be cumulated with any other State aid within the meaning of Article 87(1) of the Treaty, or with other Community funding, in relation to the same eligible costs, if such cumulation would result in an aid intensity exceeding that fixed by this Regulation.
1. On implementation of an aid scheme, or grant of individual aid outside any scheme, exempted by this Regulation, Member States shall, within 20 working days, forward to the Commission, with a view to its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities, a summary of the information regarding such aid scheme or individual aid in the form laid down in Annex II.

Article 12
laying down rules for the prevention, control and eradication of certain transmissible spongiform encephalopathies
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1),
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty(3),
(2) Since 1990 the Community has adopted a series of measures to protect human and animal health from the risk of BSE. Those measures have been based on the safeguard provisions of Directives on animal-health measures. It is appropriate, in view of the magnitude of the risk posed to human and animal health by certain TSEs, to adopt specific rules for their prevention, control and eradication.
(5) These rules should apply to the production and placing on the market of live animals and products of animal origin. However, it is not necessary for them to apply to cosmetic or medicinal products, medical devices or their starting materials or intermediate products, for which other specific rules, in particular on the non-use of specified risk material, apply. Nor should they apply to products of animal origin which do not pose a risk to animal or human health since they are intended for purposes other than the production of food, feed or fertiliser. It is appropriate to ensure that products of animal origin excluded from the scope of this Regulation are kept separate from those covered by it unless they meet at least the same health standards as the latter.
(8) Member States should institute education programmes for those involved in the prevention and control of TSEs, as well as for veterinarians, farmers and workers involved in the transportation, marketing and slaughter of farm animals.
(11) Measures should be taken to prevent the transmission of TSEs to humans or animals by prohibiting the feeding of certain categories of animal protein to certain categories of animal, and by prohibiting the use of certain ruminant materials in food. Those prohibitions should be proportionate to the risks involved.
(14) Member States should draw up contingency plans for the national measures to be implemented in the event of an outbreak of BSE. Those plans should be approved by the Commission. Provision should be made for extending this provision to TSEs other than BSE.
(17) It is necessary, in order to ensure that the rules concerning the prevention, control and eradication of TSEs are observed, for samples to be taken for laboratory testing on the basis of an established protocol which would give a full epidemiological picture of the situation as regards TSE. In order to guarantee uniform testing procedures and results, national and Community Reference Laboratories and reliable scientific methods, including rapid tests specifically for TSEs, should be established. Rapid tests should be used as far as possible.
(20) This Regulation should be re-examined as new scientific information becomes available.
(23) In order to implement this Regulation, procedures should be laid down establishing close and effective cooperation between the Commission and the Member States within the Standing Veterinary Committee, the Standing Committee on Feedingstuffs, and the Standing Committee on Foodstuffs.
CHAPTER I
Scope
(a) cosmetic or medicinal products or medical devices, or to their starting materials or intermediate products;
(d) live animals used in or intended for research.
In order to avoid cross-contamination or substitution between the live animals or of the products of animal origin referred to in Article 1(1) and the products of animal origin referred to in Article 1(2)(a), (b) and (c), or the live animals referred to in Article 1(2)(d), they shall be kept separate at all times unless such live animals or products of animal origin are produced under at least the same conditions of health protection in respect of TSEs.
Definitions
(b) placing on the market: any operation the purpose of which is to sell live animals or products of animal origin covered by this Regulation to a third party in the Community, or any other form of supply against payment or free of charge to such a third party or storage with a view to supply to such a third party;
(e) competent authority: the central authority of a Member State competent to ensure compliance with the requirements of this Regulation or any authority to which that central authority has delegated that competence, in particular for the control of feedingstuffs; it shall also include, where appropriate, the corresponding authority of a third country;

Bovine spongiform encephalopathies (BSE) shall be suspected in bovine animals which have produced a positive result from a rapid test specifically for BSE;
(k) fertilisers: any substance containing products of animal origin utilised on land to enhance growth of vegetation; it may include digestion residues from bio-gas production or composting;
2. The specific definitions set out in Annex I shall also apply.
Safeguard measures
CHAPTER II
Classification
2. A decision on each application, placing the Member State or third country or region of the Member State or third country which submitted the application in one of the categories defined in Annex II, Chapter C, shall be adopted, taking account of the criteria and potential risk factors set out in paragraph 1, in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 24(2).

Commission Decision
(2002/79/EC)
Having regard to Council Directive 93/43/EEC of 14 June 1993 on the hygiene of foodstuffs(1) and in particular Article 10(1) thereof,
(2) The Scientific Committee for Food has noted that aflatoxin B1, even at extremely low levels, causes cancer of the liver and in addition is genotoxic.
(5) A mission was carried out by the European Commission's Food and Veterinary Office (FVO) in China from 8 to 21 May 2001 to assess the control systems in place to prevent aflatoxin contamination in peanuts intended for export to the European Community. The mission revealed, inter alia, that the control over aflatoxins in peanuts is minimal in production or general processing. Deficiencies in laboratory performance were also observed. It is therefore appropriate to subject peanuts or products derived from peanuts originating in or consigned from China to special conditions to provide a high level of protection to public health.
(8) From the findings of the abovementioned mission, it can be concluded that the Chinese authorities cannot ensure currently dependable analytical results or guarantee lot integrity in respect of certification. Therefore, the reliability of any certificate issued for peanuts originating from China raises serious doubts with regard to its reliability.
HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:
- peanuts falling within CN code 1202 10 90 or 1202 20 00,
2. Consignments may only be imported into the Community through one of the points of entry listed in Annex II.
5. Member States shall undertake sampling and analysis of each consignment of peanuts originating in or consigned from China for aflatoxin B1 and total aflatoxin before release onto the market from the port of entry into the Community, and shall inform the Commission of the results.

HEREBY DECIDES:
Article 2
establishing the European Regulators Group for Electronic Communications Networks and Services
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
(1) A new regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services has been established in accordance with European Parliament and Council Directives 2002/21/EC of 7 March 2002 on a common regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services (Framework Directive)(1), 2002/19/EC of 7 March 2002 on access to, and interconnection of, electronic communications networks and associated facilities (Access Directive)(2), 2002/20/EC of 7 March 2002 on the authorisation of electronic communications networks and services (Authorisation Directive)(3) and 2002/22/EC of 7 March 2002 on the universal services and users' rights related to electronic communications networks and services (Universal Service Directive)(4).
(4) The need for the relevant rules to be consistently applied in all Member States is essential for the successful development of an internal market for electronic communications networks and services. The new regulatory framework sets out objectives to be achieved and provides a framework for action by national regulatory authorities, whilst granting them flexibility in certain areas to apply the rules in the light of national conditions.
(7) The Group should serve as a body for reflection, debate and advice for the Commission in the electronic communications field, including on matters related to the implementation and revision of Recommendation on Relevant Product and Service Markets and in drawing up the Decision on transnational markets.
HAS DECIDED AS FOLLOWS:
An advisory group of the independent national regulatory authorities on electronic communications networks and services, called the European Regulators Group for Electronic Communications Networks and Services (hereinafter referred to as the Group), is hereby established.
For the purpose of this Decision: "relevant national regulatory authority" means the public authority established in each Member State to oversee the day-to-day interpretation and application of the provisions of the Directives relating to electronic communications network and services as defined in "Framework" Directive.
The role of the Group shall be to advise and assist the Commission in consolidating the internal market for electronic communications networks and services.
Membership
Article 5
The Group shall elect a chairperson from among its members. The work of the group may be organised into subgroups and expert working groups as appropriate.
The Commission shall be represented at all meetings of the Group and be able to attend all meetings of its subgroups and expert working groups.

Entry into force
of 21 November 2002
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Whereas:
(3) The updating of the inventory of tasks should take account of the need for the protection of public health within the Community and the requirements of Community legislation in the foodstuffs sector.
(6) The measures provided for by this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,
The Annex to Decision 94/652/EC is replaced by the text in the Annex to this Decision.
Directive 2002/14/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee(2),
Whereas:
(3) The Commission consulted management and labour at Community level on the possible direction of Community action on the information and consultation of employees in undertakings within the Community.
(6) The existence of legal frameworks at national and Community level intended to ensure that employees are involved in the affairs of the undertaking employing them and in decisions which affect them has not always prevented serious decisions affecting employees from being taken and made public without adequate procedures having been implemented beforehand to inform and consult them.
(9) Timely information and consultation is a prerequisite for the success of the restructuring and adaptation of undertakings to the new conditions created by globalisation of the economy, particularly through the development of new forms of organisation of work.
(12) Entry into the third stage of economic and monetary union has extended and accelerated the competitive pressures at European level. This means that more supportive measures are needed at national level.
(15) This Directive is without prejudice to national systems regarding the exercise of this right in practice where those entitled to exercise it are required to indicate their wishes collectively.
(18) The purpose of this general framework is to establish minimum requirements applicable throughout the Community while not preventing Member States from laying down provisions more favourable to employees.
(21) However, on a transitional basis, Member States in which there is no established statutory system of information and consultation of employees or employee representation should have the possibility of further restricting the scope of the Directive as regards the numbers of employees.
(24) Care should be taken to avoid affecting some specific rules in the field of employee information and consultation existing in some national laws, addressed to undertakings or establishments which pursue political, professional, organisational, religious, charitable, educational, scientific or artistic aims, as well as aims involving information and the expression of opinions.
(27) Information and consultation imply both rights and obligations for management and labour at undertaking or establishment level.
(30) Other rights of information and consultation, including those arising from Council Directive 94/45/EEC of 22 September 1994 on the establishment of a European Works Council or a procedure in Community-scale undertakings and Community-scale groups of undertakings for the purposes of informing and consulting employees(7), should not be affected by this Directive.
Article 1
2. The practical arrangements for information and consultation shall be defined and implemented in accordance with national law and industrial relations practices in individual Member States in such a way as to ensure their effectiveness.
Definitions
(b) "establishment" means a unit of business defined in accordance with national law and practice, and located within the territory of a Member State, where an economic activity is carried out on an ongoing basis with human and material resources;
(e) "employees' representatives" means the employees' representatives provided for by national laws and/or practices;
Article 3
(a) undertakings employing at least 50 employees in any one Member State, or
2. In conformity with the principles and objectives of this Directive, Member States may lay down particular provisions applicable to undertakings or establishments which pursue directly and essentially political, professional organisational, religious, charitable, educational, scientific or artistic aims, as well as aims involving information and the expression of opinions, on condition that, at the date of entry into force of this Directive, provisions of that nature already exist in national legislation.
Practical arrangements for information and consultation
(a) information on the recent and probable development of the undertaking's or the establishment's activities and economic situation;
3. Information shall be given at such time, in such fashion and with such content as are appropriate to enable, in particular, employees' representatives to conduct an adequate study and, where necessary, prepare for consultation.
(b) at the relevant level of management and representation, depending on the subject under discussion;
(e) with a view to reaching an agreement on decisions within the scope of the employer's powers referred to in paragraph 2(c).
Member States may entrust management and labour at the appropriate level, including at undertaking or establishment level, with defining freely and at any time through negotiated agreement the practical arrangements for informing and consulting employees. These agreements, and agreements existing on the date laid down in Article 11, as well as any subsequent renewals of such agreements, may establish, while respecting the principles set out in Article 1 and subject to conditions and limitations laid down by the Member States, provisions which are different from those referred to in Article 4.
1. Member States shall provide that, within the conditions and limits laid down by national legislation, the employees' representatives, and any experts who assist them, are not authorised to reveal to employees or to third parties, any information which, in the legitimate interest of the undertaking or establishment, has expressly been provided to them in confidence. This obligation shall continue to apply, wherever the said representatives or experts are, even after expiry of their terms of office. However, a Member State may authorise the employees' representatives and anyone assisting them to pass on confidential information to employees and to third parties bound by an obligation of confidentiality.
Article 7
Article 8
2. Member States shall provide for adequate sanctions to be applicable in the event of infringement of this Directive by the employer or the employees' representatives. These sanctions must be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.
1. This Directive shall be without prejudice to the specific information and consultation procedures set out in Article 2 of Directive 98/59/EC and Article 7 of Directive 2001/23/EC.
4. Implementation of this Directive shall not be sufficient grounds for any regression in relation to the situation which already prevails in each Member State and in relation to the general level of protection of workers in the areas to which it applies.
Notwithstanding Article 3, a Member State in which there is, at the date of entry into force of this Directive, no general, permanent and statutory system of information and consultation of employees, nor a general, permanent and statutory system of employee representation at the workplace allowing employees to be represented for that purpose, may limit the application of the national provisions implementing this Directive to:
Article 11
2. Where Member States adopt these measures, they shall contain a reference to this Directive or shall be accompanied by such reference on the occasion of their official publication. The methods of making such reference shall be laid down by the Member States.
Not later than 23 March 2007, the Commission shall, in consultation with the Member States and the social partners at Community level, review the application of this Directive with a view to proposing any necessary amendments.
This Directive shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
This Directive is addressed to the Member States.
amending for the nineteenth time Council Directive 76/769/EEC relating to restrictions on the marketing and use of certain dangerous substances and preparations (azocolourants)
Having regard to the proposals from the Commission(1),
Whereas:
(3) Limitations already adopted or planned by certain Member States on the use of azodyed textile and leather articles concern the completion and functioning of the internal market. It is therefore necessary to approximate the laws of the Member States in this field and, consequently, to amend Annex I to Council Directive 76/769/EEC of 27 July 1976 on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States relating to restrictions on the marketing and use of certain dangerous substances and preparations(4).
(6) For textile articles made of recycled fibres, a maximum concentration of 70 ppm for the amines listed in point 43 in the appendix to Directive 76/769/EEC should be applied. This should be the case for a transitional period until 1 January 2005 if the amines are released by the residues deriving from the previous dyeing of the same fibres. This will allow for the recycling of textiles, which has overall benefits for the environment.
(9) In the light of new scientific knowledge, the provisions on certain azocolourants should be reviewed, in particular with regard to the need to include other materials not covered by this Directive, as well as other aromatic amines. Special attention should be paid to possible risks to children.
Article 1
Testing methods for the application of point 43 of Annex I to Directive 76/769/EEC shall be adopted by the Commission in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 2a of that Directive.
Article 4
This Directive is addressed to the Member States.
amending Council Directive 92/6/EEC on the installation and use of speed limitation devices for certain categories of motor vehicles in the Community
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1),
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty(3),
(2) The use of speed limitation devices for heaviest-motor vehicle categories has had a positive effect on the improvement of road safety. It has also contributed to environmental protection.
(5) The scope of Directive 92/6/EEC should be extended to motor vehicles of category M2, to vehicles of category M3 having a maximum mass of more than 5 tonnes but not exceeding 10 tonnes and to vehicles of category N2.
HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:
1. Articles 1 to 5 shall be replaced by the following:
Categories M2, M3, N2 and N3 shall be understood to be those defined in Annex II to Directive 70/156/EEC(6).
Category M3 vehicles registered before 1 January 2005 with a maximum mass exceeding 10 tonnes may continue to be equipped with devices on which the maximum speed is set at 100 kilometres per hour.
2. Member States shall be authorised to require that the speed limitation device in vehicles registered in their territory and used exclusively for the transport of dangerous goods is set in such a way that those vehicles cannot exceed a maximum speed of less than 90 kilometres per hour.
(a) to vehicles registered as from 1 January 1994, from 1 January 1994;
(ii) from 1 January 1996, in the case of vehicles used exclusively for national transport.
(b) to vehicles complying with the limit values set out in Directive 88/77/EEC(7) registered between 1 October 2001 and 1 January 2005:
3. For a period of no more than three years from 1 January 2005, any Member State may exempt from the provisions of Articles 2 and 3 category M2 vehicles and category N2 vehicles with a maximum mass of more than 3,5 tonnes but not exceeding 7,5 tonnes, registered in the national register and not travelling on the territory of another Member State.
2. Speed limitation devices shall be installed by workshops or bodies approved by the Member States."
As part of the road safety action programme for the period 2002 to 2010, the Commission shall assess the road safety and road traffic implications of adjusting the speed limitation devices used by category M2 vehicles and by category N2 vehicles with a maximum mass of 7,5 tonnes or less to the speeds laid down by this Directive.
Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by 1 January 2005 at the latest. They shall forthwith inform the Commission thereof.
This Directive shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
Directive 2002/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee(2),
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty(4),
(2) New developments in financial markets have led to the creation of financial groups which provide services and products in different sectors of the financial markets, called financial conglomerates. Until now, there has been no form of prudential supervision on a group-wide basis of credit institutions, insurance undertakings and investment firms which are part of such a conglomerate, in particular as regards the solvency position and risk concentration at the level of the conglomerate, the intra-group transactions, the internal risk management processes at conglomerate level, and the fit and proper character of the management. Some of these conglomerates are among the biggest financial groups which are active in the financial markets and provide services on a global basis. If such conglomerates, and in particular credit institutions, insurance undertakings and investment firms which are part of such a conglomerate, were to face financial difficulties, these could seriously destabilise the financial system and affect individual depositors, insurance policy holders and investors.
(5) In order to be effective, the supplementary supervision of credit institutions, insurance undertakings and investment firms in a financial conglomerate should be applied to all such conglomerates, the cross-sectoral financial activities of which are significant, which is the case when certain thresholds are reached, no matter how they are structured. Supplementary supervision should cover all financial activities identified by the sectoral financial legislation and all entities principally engaged in such activities should be included in the scope of the supplementary supervision, including asset management companies.
(8) Financial conglomerates are often managed on a business-line basis which does not fully coincide with the conglomerate's legal structures. In order to take account of this trend, the requirements for management should be further extended, in particular as regards the management of the mixed financial holding company.
(11) The competent authorities involved, and especially the coordinator, should have the means of obtaining from the entities within a financial conglomerate, or from other competent authorities, the information necessary for the performance of their supplementary supervision.
(14) Equivalent and appropriate supplementary supervisory arrangements can only be assumed to exist if the third-country supervisory authorities have agreed to cooperate with the competent authorities concerned on the means and objectives of exercising supplementary supervision of the regulated entities of a financial conglomerate.
(17) This Directive respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.
(20) The existing sectoral rules for credit institutions, insurance undertakings and investment firms should be supplemented to a minimum level, in particular to avoid regulatory arbitrage between the sectoral rules and those for financial conglomerates. Therefore, First Council Directive 73/239/EEC of 24 July 1973 on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to the taking up and pursuit of the business of direct insurance other than life assurance(6), First Council Directive 79/267/EEC of 5 March 1979 on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to the taking up and pursuit of the business of direct life assurance(7), Council Directive 92/49/EEC of 18 June 1992 on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to direct insurance other than life insurance (third non-life insurance Directive)(8), Council Directive 92/96/EEC of 10 November 1992 on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to direct life assurance (third life insurance Directive)(9), Council Directive 93/6/EEC of 15 March 1993 on the capital adequacy of investments firms and credit institutions(10) and Council Directive 93/22/EEC of 10 May 1993 on investment services in the securities field(11), as well as Directive 98/78/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 October 1998 on the supplementary supervision of insurance undertakings in an insurance group(12) and Directive 2000/12/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 March 2000 relating to the taking up and pursuit of the business of credit institutions(13) should be amended accordingly. The objective of further harmonisation can, however, only be achieved by stages and needs to be based on careful analysis.
CHAPTER I
Objective
Definitions
2. "insurance undertaking" shall mean an insurance undertaking within the meaning of Article 6 of Directive 73/239/EEC, Article 6 of Directive 79/267/EEC or Article 1(b) of Directive 98/78/EC;
5. "asset management company" shall mean a management company within the meaning of Article 1a(2) of Council Directive 85/611/EEC of 20 December 1985 on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS)(14), as well as an undertaking the registered office of which is outside the Community and which would require authorisation in accordance with Article 5(1) of that Directive if it had its registered office within the Community;
8. "financial sector" shall mean a sector composed of one or more of the following entities:
(c) an investment firm or a financial institution within the meaning of Article 2(7) of Directive 93/6/EEC (the investment services sector);
10. "subsidiary undertaking" shall mean a subsidiary undertaking within the meaning of Article 1 of Directive 83/349/EEC and any undertaking over which, in the opinion of the competent authorities, a parent undertaking effectively exercises a dominant influence; all subsidiary undertakings of subsidiary undertakings shall also be considered as subsidiary undertakings of the parent undertaking;
13. "close links" shall mean a situation in which two or more natural or legal persons are linked by:
A situation in which two or more natural or legal persons are permanently linked to one and the same person by a control relationship shall also be regarded as constituting a close link between such persons;
(b) where there is a regulated entity within the meaning of Article 1 at the head of the group, it is either a parent undertaking of an entity in the financial sector, an entity which holds a participation in an entity in the financial sector, or an entity linked with an entity in the financial sector by a relationship within the meaning of Article 12(1) of Directive 83/349/EEC;
(e) the consolidated and/or aggregated activities of the entities in the group within the insurance sector and the consolidated and/or aggregated activities of the entities within the banking and investment services sector are both significant within the meaning of Article 3(2) or (3).
16. "competent authorities" shall mean the national authorities of the Member States which are empowered by law or regulation to supervise credit institutions, and/or insurance undertakings and/or investment firms whether on an individual or a group-wide basis;
(b) the coordinator appointed in accordance with Article 10 if different from the authorities referred to in (a);
19. "risk concentration" shall mean all exposures with a loss potential borne by entities within a financial conglomerate, which are large enough to threaten the solvency or the financial position in general of the regulated entities in the financial conglomerate; such exposures may be caused by counterparty risk/credit risk, investment risk, insurance risk, market risk, other risks, or a combination or interaction of these risks.
1. For the purposes of determining whether the activities of a group mainly occur in the financial sector, within the meaning of Article 2(14)(c), the ratio of the balance sheet total of the regulated and non-regulated financial sector entities in the group to the balance sheet total of the group as a whole should exceed 40 %.
3. Cross-sectoral activities shall also be presumed to be significant within the meaning of Article 2(14)(e) if the balance sheet total of the smallest financial sector in the group exceeds EUR 6 billion. If the group does not reach the threshold referred to in paragraph 2, the relevant competent authorities may decide by common agreement not to regard the group as a financial conglomerate, or not to apply the provisions of Articles 7, 8 or 9, if they are of the opinion that the inclusion of the group in the scope of this Directive or the application of such provisions is not necessary or would be inappropriate or misleading with respect to the objectives of supplementary supervision, taking into account, for instance, the fact that:
Decisions taken in accordance with this paragraph shall be notified to the other competent authorities concerned.
(b) take into account compliance with the thresholds envisaged in paragraphs 1 and 2 for three consecutive years so as to avoid sudden regime shifts, and disregard such compliance if there are significant changes in the group's structure.
6. For the application of paragraphs 1 and 2, if the ratios referred to in those paragraphs fall below 40 % and 10 % respectively for conglomerates already subject to supplementary supervision, a lower ratio of 35 % and 8 % respectively shall apply for the following three years to avoid sudden regime shifts.
7. The calculations referred to in this Article regarding the balance sheet shall be made on the basis of the aggregated balance sheet total of the entities of the group, according to their annual accounts. For the purposes of this calculation, undertakings in which a participation is held shall be taken into account as regards the amount of their balance sheet total corresponding to the aggregated proportional share held by the group. However, where consolidated accounts are available, they shall be used instead of aggregated accounts.
Identifying a financial conglomerate
- competent authorities which have authorised regulated entities in the group shall, where necessary, cooperate closely,
CHAPTER II
SCOPE
1. Without prejudice to the provisions on supervision contained in the sectoral rules, Member States shall provide for the supplementary supervision of the regulated entities referred to in Article 1, to the extent and in the manner prescribed in this Directive.
(b) every regulated entity, the parent undertaking of which is a mixed financial holding company which has its head office in the Community;
3. Every regulated entity which is not subject to supplementary supervision in accordance with paragraph 2, the parent undertaking of which is a regulated entity or a mixed financial holding company, having its head office outside the Community, shall be subject to supplementary supervision at the level of the financial conglomerate to the extent and in the manner prescribed in Article 18.
For the purposes of applying the first subparagraph to "cooperative groups", the competent authorities must take into account the public financial commitment of these groups with respect to other financial entities.
FINANCIAL POSITION
1. Without prejudice to the sectoral rules, supplementary supervision of the capital adequacy of the regulated entities in a financial conglomerate shall be exercised in accordance with the rules laid down in Article 9(2) to (5), in Section 3 of this Chapter, and in Annex I.
The requirements referred to in the first and second subparagraphs shall be subject to supervisory overview by the coordinator in accordance with Section 3.
3. For the purposes of calculating the capital adequacy requirements referred to in the first subparagraph of paragraph 2, the following entities shall be included in the scope of supplementary supervision in the manner and to the extent defined in Annex I:
(c) an investment firm or a financial institution within the meaning of Article 2(7) of Directive 93/6/EEC;
When applying methods 2 or 3 (Deduction and aggregation, Book value/Requirement deduction) referred to in Annex I, the calculation shall take account of the proportional share held by the parent undertaking or undertaking which holds a participation in another entity of the group. "Proportional share" means the proportion of the subscribed capital which is held, directly or indirectly, by that undertaking.
(b) if the entity is of negligible interest with respect to the objectives of the supplementary supervision of regulated entities in a financial conglomerate;
In the case mentioned in (c) of the first subparagraph the coordinator shall, except in cases of urgency, consult the other relevant competent authorities before taking a decision.
Risk concentration
These risk concentrations shall be subject to supervisory overview by the coordinator in accordance with Section 3.
Article 8
2. The Member States shall require regulated entities or mixed financial holding companies to report, on a regular basis and at least annually, to the coordinator all significant intra-group transactions of regulated entities within a financial conglomerate, in accordance with the rules laid down in this Article and in Annex II. Insofar as no definition of the thresholds referred to in the last sentence of the first paragraph of Annex II has been drawn up, an intra-group transaction shall be presumed to be significant if its amount exceeds at least 5 % of the total amount of capital adequacy requirements at the level of a financial conglomerate.
3. Pending further coordination of Community legislation, Member States may set quantitative limits and qualitative requirements or allow their competent authorities to set quantitative limits and qualitative requirements, or take other supervisory measures that would achieve the objectives of supplementary supervision, with regard to intra-group transactions of regulated entities within a financial conglomerate.
Internal control mechanisms and risk management processes
(a) sound governance and management with the approval and periodical review of the strategies and policies by the appropriate governing bodies at the level of the financial conglomerate with respect to all the risks they assume;
3. The internal control mechanisms shall include:
4. The Member States shall ensure that, in all undertakings included in the scope of supplementary supervision pursuant to Article 5, there are adequate internal control mechanisms for the production of any data and information which would be relevant for the purposes of the supplementary supervision.
MEASURES TO FACILITATE SUPPLEMENTARY SUPERVISION
1. In order to ensure proper supplementary supervision of the regulated entities in a financial conglomerate, a single coordinator, responsible for coordination and exercise of supplementary supervision, shall be appointed from among the competent authorities of the Member States concerned, including those of the Member State in which the mixed financial holding company has its head office.
(b) where a financial conglomerate is not headed by a regulated entity, the task of coordinator shall be exercised by the competent authority identified in accordance with the following principles:
Where more than one regulated entity, being active in different financial sectors, have been authorised in the Member State in which the mixed financial holding company has its head office, the task of coordinator shall be exercised by the competent authority of the regulated entity active in the most important financial sector.
(iv) where the financial conglomerate is a group without a parent undertaking at the top, or in any other case, the task of coordinator shall be exercised by the competent authority which authorised the regulated entity with the largest balance sheet total in the most important financial sector.
Tasks of the coordinator
(b) supervisory overview and assessment of the financial situation of a financial conglomerate;
(e) planning and coordination of supervisory activities in going concern as well as in emergency situations, in cooperation with the relevant competent authorities involved;
2. The coordinator should, when it needs information which has already been given to another competent authority in accordance with the sectoral rules, contact this authority whenever possible in order to prevent duplication of reporting to the various authorities involved in supervision.
Cooperation and exchange of information between competent authorities
(a) identification of the group structure of all major entities belonging to the financial conglomerate, as well as of the competent authorities of the regulated entities in the group;
(d) the financial conglomerate's major shareholders and management;
(g) adverse developments in regulated entities or in other entities of the financial conglomerate which could seriously affect the regulated entities;
2. Without prejudice to their respective responsibilities as defined under sectoral rules, the competent authorities concerned shall, prior to their decision, consult each other with regard to the following items, where these decisions are of importance for other competent authorities' supervisory tasks:
A competent authority may decide not to consult in cases of urgency or where such consultation may jeopardise the effectiveness of the decisions. In this case, the competent authority shall, without delay, inform the other competent authorities.
4. Member States shall authorise the exchange of the information between their competent authorities and between their competent authorities and other authorities, as referred to in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3. The collection or possession of information with regard to an entity within a financial conglomerate which is not a regulated entity shall not in any way imply that the competent authorities are required to play a supervisory role in relation to these entities on a stand-alone basis.
Management body of mixed financial holding companies
Access to information
Article 15
The authorities which receive such a request shall, within the framework of their competences, act upon it either by carrying out the verification themselves, by allowing an auditor or expert to carry it out, or by allowing the authority which made the request to carry it out itself.
Enforcement measures
- by the competent authorities with respect to the regulated entities; to that end, the coordinator shall inform those competent authorities of its findings.
Article 17
2. Without prejudice to their criminal law provisions, Member States shall ensure that penalties or measures aimed at ending observed breaches or the causes of such breaches may be imposed on mixed financial holding companies, or their effective managers, which infringe laws, regulations or administrative provisions enacted to implement this Directive. In certain cases, such measures may require the intervention of the courts. The competent authorities shall cooperate closely to ensure that such penalties or measures produce the desired results.
Article 18
2. In the absence of equivalent supervision referred to in paragraph 1, Member States shall apply to the regulated entities, by analogy, the provisions concerning the supplementary supervision of regulated entities referred to in Article 5(2). As an alternative, competent authorities may apply one of the methods set out in paragraph 3.
Cooperation with third-country competent authorities
CHAPTER III
Powers conferred on the Commission
(b) a more precise formulation of the definitions referred to in Article 2 in order to ensure uniform application of this Directive in the Community;
(e) coordination of the provisions adopted pursuant to Articles 7 and 8 and Annex II with a view to encouraging uniform application within the Community.
Committee
The period laid down in Article 5(6) of Decision 1999/468/EC shall be set at three months.
5. The Committee may give general guidance as to whether the supplementary supervision arrangements of competent authorities in third countries are likely to achieve the objectives of the supplementary supervision as defined in this Directive, in relation to the regulated entities in a financial conglomerate, the head of which has its head office outside the Community. The Committee shall keep any such guidance under review and take into account any changes to the supplementary supervision carried out by such competent authorities.

- the definition of significant intra-group transactions and significant risk concentration and the supervision of intra-group transactions and risk concentration referred to in Annex II, in particular regarding the introduction of quantitative limits and qualitative requirements for this purpose,
2. Within one year of agreement being reached at international level on the rules for eliminating the double gearing of own funds in financial groups, the Commission shall examine how to bring the provisions of this Directive into line with those international agreements and, if necessary, make appropriate proposals.
When Member States adopt these measures, they shall contain a reference to this Directive or shall be accompanied by such reference on the occasion of their official publication. The methods of making such reference shall be laid down by Member States.
This Directive shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.
This Directive is addressed to the Member States.
amending the Annexes to Council Directives 86/362/EEC, 86/363/EEC and 90/642/EEC as regards the fixing of maximum levels for pesticide residues (2,4-D, triasulfuron and thifensulfuron methyl) in and on cereals, foodstuffs of animal origin and certain products of plant origin, including fruit and vegetables
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 90/642/EEC of 27 November 1990 on fixing of maximum levels for pesticide residues in and on certain products of plant origin including fruit and vegetables(4), as last amended by Directive 2002/79/EC, and in particular Article 7 thereof,
(1) The existing active substances 2,4-D, triasulfuron and thifensulfuron methyl, (the active substances concerned), were included in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC by Commission Directives 2001/103/EC(7), 2000/66/EC(8) and 2001/99/EC(9), respectively, for use as herbicides, but without specifying particular conditions having an impact on crops which may be treated with plant protection products containing this active substance.
(4) With respect to the inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC of the active substance concerned, the related technical and scientific evaluations were finalised in the form of the Commission review report. The report was finalised on 2 October 2001 for 2,4-D, on 13 July 2000 for triasulfuron and on 29 June 2001 for thifensulfuron methyl. The reports fixed the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) for 2,4-D at 0,05 mg/kg bw/day, for triasulfuron at 0,01 mg/kg bw/day and for thifensulfuron methyl at 0,01 mg/kg bw/day. The lifetime exposure of consumers of food products treated with the active substances concerned has been assessed and evaluated in accordance with Community procedures. Account has also been taken of guidelines published by the World Health Organisation(10) and the opinion of the Scientific Committee for Plants(11) on the methodology employed. It is concluded that MRLs proposed will not lead to those ADIs being exceeded. No acute toxic effects requiring the setting of an Acute Reference Dose were noted during the evaluations and discussions preceding the inclusion of the active substances concerned in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC.
(7) The Annexes to Directives 86/362/EEC, 86/363/EEC and 90/642/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
(1) Regulation (EC) No 2529/2001 sets up a new system of premia to replace the system set out in Council Regulation (EC) No 2467/98 of 3 November 1998 on the common organisation of the market in sheepmeat and goatmeat(2), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1669/2000(3). In order to take into account the new arrangements and in the interests of clarity it is necessary to establish new rules to replace those set out in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1481/86 of 15 May 1986 on the determination of prices of fresh or chilled lamb carcasses on representative Community markets and the survey of prices of certain other qualities of sheep carcasses in the Community(4), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2877/2000(5).
(4) The prices recorded on the market shall be based on the prices, excluding value added tax, of carcasses, but with no deductions authorised in respect of other charges. Market prices should be recorded in respect of the "carcass weight" as defined in Commission Decision 94/434/EC of 30 May 1994 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Directive 93/25/EEC as regards the statistical surveys to be carried out by Member States on sheep and goat population and production(6), as last amended by Decision 1999/47/EC(7). However, it should be permitted that this definition be not used in the case of carcasses of young lambs weighing between 9 and 16 kilograms, so that market practices, whereby whole carcasses marketed with head and offals command a greater commercial value, can be taken into account.
(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Sheep and Goats,
1. Member States whose sheep meat production exceeds 200 tonnes per year shall communicate to the Commission, each Thursday at the latest, the prices of fresh or chilled carcasses of lambs and ewes.
1. Market prices shall be recorded in respect of the "carcass weight" within the meaning of Decision 94/434/EC.
Where prices are recorded on a liveweight basis, the prices per kilogram liveweight shall be divided by a maximum conversion coefficient of 0,5. However, where normal practice is to include head and offals with the carcass, for lambs weighing up to 28 kilograms liveweight the Member States may fix a higher coefficient.
1. Where markets are held more than once during the seven-day period referred to in Article 2(1), the price of each category shall be the arithmetical average of the quotations recorded during each market.

establishing a European Maritime Safety Agency
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 80(2) thereof,
Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions(3),
(1) A large number of legislative measures have been adopted in the Community in order to enhance safety and prevent pollution in maritime transport. In order to be effective, such legislation must be applied in a proper and uniform manner throughout the Community. This will ensure a level playing field, reduce the distortion of competition resulting from the economic advantages enjoyed by non-complying ships and will reward the serious maritime players.
(4) For the proper achievement of the purposes for which the Agency is established, it is appropriate that the Agency carries out a number of other important tasks aimed at enhancing maritime safety and ship pollution prevention in the waters of the Member States. In this respect, the Agency should work with Member States to organise appropriate training activities on port State control and flag State related issues and to provide technical assistance related to the implementation of Community legislation. It should facilitate cooperation between the Member States and the Commission as provided for in Directive 2002/59/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 June 2002 establishing a Community vessel traffic monitoring and information system and repealing Council Directive 93/75/EEC(5), namely by developing and operating any information system necessary for the objectives of that Directive, and in the activities concerning the investigations related to serious maritime accidents. It should provide the Commission and the Member States with objective, reliable and comparable information and data on maritime safety and on ship pollution prevention to enable them to take any necessary initiatives to enhance the measures in place and to evaluate their effectiveness. It should place the Community maritime safety know-how at the disposal of the States applying for accession. It should be open to the participation of these States and to other third countries which have concluded agreements with the Community whereby they adopt and implement Community legislation in the field of maritime safety and prevention of pollution by ships.
(7) The Agency should apply the relevant Community legislation concerning public access to documents and the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data. It should give the public and any interested party objective, reliable and easily understandable information with regard to its work.
(10) The good functioning of the Agency requires that its Executive Director be appointed on the grounds of merit and documented administrative and managerial skills, as well as competence and experience relevant for maritime safety and prevention of pollution by ships and that he/she performs his/her duties with complete independence and flexibility as to the organisation of the internal functioning of the Agency. To this end, the Executive Director should prepare and take all necessary steps to ensure the proper accomplishment of the working programme of the Agency, should prepare each year a draft general report to be submitted to the Administrative Board, should draw up estimates of the revenues and expenditure of the Agency and should implement the budget.
(13) Within five years from the date of the Agency having taken up its responsibilities, the Administrative Board should commission an independent external evaluation in order to assess the impact of this Regulation, the Agency and its working practices on establishing a high level of maritime safety and prevention of pollution by ships,

of 3 October 2002
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 152(4)(b) thereof,
Having consulted the Committee of the Regions,
(1) Council Directive 90/667/EEC of 27 November 1990 laying down the veterinary rules for the disposal and processing of animal waste, for its placing on the market and for the prevention of pathogens in feedingstuffs of animal or fish origin and amending Directive 90/425/EEC(4) established the principle that all animal waste, regardless of its source, may be used for the production of feed material following appropriate treatment.
(4) In the light of the experience gained in recent years, it is appropriate to clarify the relationship between Directive 90/667/EEC and Community environmental legislation. This Regulation should not affect the application of existing environmental legislation or hinder the development of new rules on environmental protection, particularly as regards biodegradable waste. In this regard, the Commission has given a commitment that by the end of the year 2004 a Directive on biowaste, including catering waste, will be prepared with the aim of establishing rules on safe use, recovery, recycling and disposal of this waste and of controlling potential contamination.
(7) Scientific advice suggests that the practice of feeding an animal species with proteins derived from the bodies, or parts of bodies, of the same species presents a risk of spreading disease. As a precautionary measure, this practice should therefore be prohibited. Implementing rules should be adopted to ensure the necessary separation of animal by-products destined for use in feed at every stage of processing, storage and transport. However, there should be scope to establish derogations from this general prohibition in relation to fish and fur animals if justified by scientific advice.
(10) To avoid any risk of dispersal of pathogens and/or residues, animal by-products should be processed, stored and kept separated in an approved and supervised plant designated by the Member State concerned or be disposed of in a suitable manner. In certain circumstances, especially when it is justified by distance, time of transport, or capacity problems, the designated processing, incineration or co-incineration plant could be located in another Member State.
(13) Derogations from the rules on the use of animal by-products may be appropriate to facilitate the feeding of animals not destined for human consumption. The competent authorities should control such uses.
(16) The basis for Community legislation on health issues is sound science. To this end, the relevant scientific committees set up by Commission Decisions 97/404/EC(7) and 97/579/EC(8) should be consulted wherever necessary. In particular, further scientific advice is required on the use of products of animal origin in organic fertilisers and soil improvers. Pending the adoption of Community rules in the light of this advice, Member States may maintain or adopt national rules that are stricter than those envisaged in this Regulation, provided that such rules comply with other applicable Community legislation.
(19) Animal by-products not destined for human consumption (in particular processed animal protein, rendered fats, petfood, hides and skins and wool) are included in the list of products in Annex I to the Treaty. The placing on the market of such products constitutes an important source of income for part of the farming population. To ensure rational development in this sector and increase productivity, animal health and public health rules for the products in question should be laid down at Community level. Given the significant risks of the spread of diseases to which animals are exposed, particular requirements should apply to the placing on the market of certain animal by-products, particularly in regions with a high health status.
(22) The accompanying document for products of animal origin is the best way of satisfying the competent authority of the place of destination that a consignment complies with the provisions of this Regulation. The health certificate should be maintained for the purposes of verifying the destination of certain imported products.
(25) Such simplification will lead to more transparency with regard to specific health rules for products of animal origin not destined for human consumption. Simplification of the specific health legislation must not lead to deregulation. It is therefore necessary to maintain and, to ensure public and animal health protection, to tighten the detailed health rules for products of animal origin not destined for human consumption.
(28) Directive 90/667/EEC, Council Decision 95/348/EC of 22 June 1995 laying down the veterinary and animal health rules applicable in the United Kingdom and Ireland to the treatment of certain types of waste intended to be marketed locally as feedstuffs for certain animal categories(13) and Council Decision 1999/534/EC of 19 July 1999 on measures applying to the processing of certain animal waste to protect against transmissible spongiform encephalopathies and amending Commission Decision 97/735/EC(14) should therefore be repealed.
HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:

Article 2
of 5 November 2002
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 80(2) thereof,
Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions(3),
(1) The measures implementing the existing Regulations and Directives in the field of maritime safety were adopted by a regulatory procedure involving the Committee set up by Council Directive 93/75/EEC of 13 September 1993 concerning minimum requirements for vessels bound for or leaving Community ports and carrying dangerous or polluting goods(5) and, in certain cases, an ad hoc committee. These committees were governed by the rules set out in Council Decision 87/373/EEC of 13 July 1987 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(6).
(4) In keeping with the Resolution of 8 June 1993, a Committee on Safe Seas and the Prevention of Pollution from Ships should be set up and assigned the tasks previously devolved to the committees established under the aforesaid legislation. All new Community legislation adopted in the field of maritime safety should stipulate recourse to the Committee thereby set up.
(7) The aforesaid legislation should also be amended to substitute COSS for the Committee set up by Directive 93/75/EEC or, where appropriate, for the ad hoc committee established under any particular act. This Regulation should in particular amend the relevant provisions of Council Regulations (EEC) No 613/91 of 4 March 1991 on the transfer of ships from one register to another within the Community(9), (EC) No 2978/94 of 21 November 1994 on the implementation of IMO Resolution A.747(18) on the application of tonnage measurement of ballast spaces in segregated ballast oil tankers(10), (EC) No 3051/95 of 8 December 1995 on the safety management of roll-on/roll-off passenger ferries (ro-ro ferries)(11) and Regulation (EC) No 417/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 February 2002 on the accelerated phasing-in of double hull or equivalent design requirements for single hull oil tankers and repealing Council Regulation (EC) No 2978/94(12), in order to insert a reference to COSS and to stipulate the regulatory procedure laid down in Article 5 of Decision 1999/468/EC.
(10) Member States should therefore be permitted to apply the most recent provisions of international instruments, with the exception of those explicitly incorporated in a Community act. This can be done by stating that the international convention applicable for the purposes of the Directive or Regulation concerned is that "in its up-to-date version", without mentioning the date.
(13) The conformity checking procedure will only be fully effective if the planned measures are adopted as speedily as possible, but at all events before the expiry of the deadline for the entry into force of the international amendment. Consequently, the time available to the Council to act on the proposed measures in accordance with Article 5(6) of Decision 1999/468/EC should be one month,
Purpose

For the purposes of Community maritime legislation, the applicable international instruments shall be those which have entered into force, including the most recent amendments thereto, with the exception of the amendments excluded from the scope of the Community maritime legislation resulting from the conformity checking procedure established by Article 5.
1. For the purposes of this Regulation and with a view to reducing the risks of conflict between the Community maritime legislation and international instruments, Member States and the Commission shall cooperate, through coordination meetings and/or any other appropriate means, in order to define, as appropriate, a common position or approach in the competent international fora.
3. In the circumstances referred to in paragraph 2, the conformity checking procedure shall be initiated by the Commission, which, where appropriate, may act at the request of a Member State.
4. In the event of a risk as referred to in the first subparagraph of paragraph 2, Member States shall refrain, during the period of the conformity checking procedure, from any initiative intended to integrate the amendment in national legislation or to apply the amendment to the international instrument concerned.
All relevant amendments to international instruments that are integrated in Community maritime legislation, in accordance with Articles 4 and 5, shall be published, for information purposes, in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
COSS shall exercise the powers conferred on it by virtue of the Community legislation in force. Article 2(2) may be amended by the procedure set out in Article 3(2) in order to include a reference to the Community acts conferring implementing powers on COSS that have entered into force following the adoption of this Regulation.

In order to be consistent with that Directive, Directive 2000/30/EC also needs to be adapted so as to include the new technical provisions, namely by bringing on-board diagnostic (OBD) monitoring systems and speed limiters within the scope of roadside inspections. Directive 2000/30/EC also needs updating (together with Directive 96/96/EC) to incorporate revised emission testing limit values for certain categories of motor vehicles.
Article 1
1. Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by 1 January 2004 at the latest. They shall forthwith inform the Commission thereof.
Article 3
on the promotion of the use of biofuels or other renewable fuels for transport
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1),
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty(4),
(2) Natural resources, and their prudent and rational utilisation as referred to in Article 174(1) of the Treaty, include oil, natural gas and solid fuels, which are essential sources of energy but also the leading sources of carbon dioxide emissions.
(5) The Commission White Paper "European transport policy for 2010: time to decide" expects CO2 emissions from transport to rise by 50 % between 1990 and 2010, to around 1113 million tonnes, the main responsibility resting with road transport, which accounts for 84 % of transport-related CO2 emissions. From an ecological point of view, the White Paper therefore calls for dependence on oil (currently 98 %) in the transport sector to be reduced by using alternative fuels such as biofuels.
(8) As a result of technological advances, most vehicles currently in circulation in the European Union are capable of using a low biofuel blend without any problem. The most recent technological developments make it possible to use higher percentages of biofuel in the blend. Some countries are already using biofuel blends of 10 % and higher.
(11) The research policy pursued by the Member States relating to increased use of biofuels should incorporate the hydrogen sector to a significant degree and promote this option, taking into account the relevant Community framework programmes.
(14) Bioethanol and biodiesel, when used for vehicles in pure form or as a blend, should comply with the quality standards laid down to ensure optimum engine performance. It is noted that in the case of biodiesel for diesel engines, where the processing option is esterification, the standard prEN 14214 of the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) on fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) could be applied. Accordingly, the CEN should establish appropriate standards for other transport biofuel products in the European Union.
(17) The Commission Green Paper "Towards a European strategy for the security of energy supply" sets the objective of 20 % substitution of conventional fuels by alternative fuels in the road transport sector by the year 2020.
(20) The optimum method for increasing the share of biofuels in the national and Community markets depends on the availability of resources and raw materials, on national and Community policies to promote biofuels and on tax arrangements, and on the appropriate involvement of all stakeholders/parties.
(23) Since the objective of the proposed action, namely the introduction of general principles providing for a minimum percentage of biofuels to be marketed and distributed, cannot be achieved sufficiently by the Member States by reason of the scale of the action, and can therefore be achieved better at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.
(26) Provision should be made for the possibility of adapting rapidly the list of biofuels, the percentage of renewable contents, and the schedule for introducing biofuels in the transport fuel market, to technical progress and to the results of an environmental impact assessment of the first phase of introduction.
(29) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Directive should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(7),
This Directive aims at promoting the use of biofuels or other renewable fuels to replace diesel or petrol for transport purposes in each Member State, with a view to contributing to objectives such as meeting climate change commitments, environmentally friendly security of supply and promoting renewable energy sources.
(a) "biofuels" means liquid or gaseous fuel for transport produced from biomass;
(d) "energy content" means the lower calorific value of a fuel.
(b) "biodiesel": a methyl-ester produced from vegetable or animal oil, of diesel quality, to be used as biofuel;
(e) "biodimethylether": dimethylether produced from biomass, to be used as biofuel;
(h) "synthetic biofuels": synthetic hydrocarbons or mixtures of synthetic hydrocarbons, which have been produced from biomass;
Article 3
(ii) A reference value for these targets shall be 5,75 %, calculated on the basis of energy content, of all petrol and diesel for transport purposes placed on their markets by 31 December 2010.
(b) as biofuels blended in mineral oil derivatives, in accordance with the appropriate European norms describing the technical specifications for transport fuels (EN 228 and EN 590);
4. In the measures that they take, the Member States should consider the overall climate and environmental balance of the various types of biofuels and other renewable fuels and may give priority to the promotion of those fuels showing a very good cost-effective environmental balance, while also taking into account competitiveness and security of supply.
1. Member States shall report to the Commission, before 1 July each year, on:
- the total sales of transport fuel and the share of biofuels, pure or blended, and other renewable fuels placed on the market for the preceding year. Where appropriate, Member States shall report on any exceptional conditions in the supply of crude oil or oil products that have affected the marketing of biofuels and other renewable fuels.
(a) objective factors such as the limited national potential for production of biofuels from biomass;
2. By 31 December 2006 at the latest, and every two years thereafter, the Commission shall draw up an evaluation report for the European Parliament and for the Council on the progress made in the use of biofuels and other renewable fuels in the Member States.
(b) the economic aspects and the environmental impact of further increasing the share of biofuels and other renewable fuels;
(e) the assessment of the use of biofuels and other renewable fuels with respect to their differentiating effects on climate change and their impact on CO2 emissions reduction;
Article 5
1. The Commission shall be assisted by a Committee.
3. The Committee shall adopt its Rules of Procedure.
When Member States adopt these measures, they shall contain a reference to this Directive or be accompanied by such reference on the occasion of their official publication. The methods of making such a reference shall be laid down by the Member States.
This Directive shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.
Commission Directive 2003/60/EC
(Text with EEA relevance)
Having regard to Council Directive 76/895/EEC of 23 November 1976 relating to the fixing of maximum levels for pesticide residues in and on fruit and vegetables(1), as last amended by Commission Directive 2002/79/EC(2), and in particular Article 5 thereof,
Having regard to Council Directive 90/642/EEC of 27 November 1990 on fixing of maximum levels for pesticide residues in and on certain products of plant origin including fruit and vegetables(5), as last amended by Commission Directive 2002/100/EC(6), and in particular Article 7 thereof,
(1) The existing active substances amitrole, diquat, isoproturon and ethofumesate, were included in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC by Commission Directives 2001/21/EC(9), 2002/18/EC(10) and 2002/37/EC(11), respectively.
(4) Where no Community MRL or provisional MRL exists, Member States are to establish a national provisional MRL in accordance with Article 4(1)(f) of Directive 91/414/EEC before plant protection products containing these active substances may be authorised.
(7) Community MRLs and the levels recommended by the Codex Alimentarius are fixed and evaluated following similar procedures. There are a limited number of Codex MRLs for diquat and fentin (-acetate or -hydroxide). These have been considered in the setting of the MRLs fixed in this Directive. Codex MRLs that will be recommended for withdrawal in the near future were not taken into account. The MRLs based on Codex MRLs having been evaluated in the light of the risks for the consumers, no risk was established when using the toxicological end points based on the studies available to the Commission.
(10) The setting at Community level of such provisional MRLs does not prevent the Member States from establishing provisional MRLs for the substances in this Directive in accordance with Article 4(1)(f) of Directive 91/414/EEC and Annex VI thereto. It is considered that a period of four years is sufficient to permit further uses of the active substance concerned. The provisional MRL should then become definitive.
(13) This Directive is in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,
In Annex II to Directive 76/895/EEC the entries relating to diquat shall be deleted.
Article 3
The maximum pesticide residue levels as shown in Annex IV to this Directive are added to Annex II to Directive 90/642/EEC.
They shall apply these provisions with effect from 1 July 2003, except for the provisions for fentin hydroxide, fentin acetate and chlorfenapyr, which they shall apply by 1 July 2004.
This Directive shall enter into force on the 20th day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.
Commission Regulation (EC) No 568/2003
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Whereas:
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.
amending Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards rapid tests
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
(1) Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 sets out a list of national reference laboratories for TSEs for the purposes of that Regulation. Greece has changed its national reference laboratory.
(4) In its opinion of 6 and 7 March 2003, the Scientific Steering Committee recommended the inclusion of two new tests in the list of rapid tests approved for monitoring of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). The producers of both tests have provided data showing that their test may also be used for monitoring of TSE in sheep.
(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,
Annex X to Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.
Commission Regulation (EC) No 1139/2003
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Whereas:
(3) There is a theoretical possibility that BSE may exist in the ovine and caprine population. It is not possible using routine methods to distinguish between BSE and scrapie infection in these animals. The level of infectivity in the ileum in both diseases is significant from an early stage of infection. As a precautionary measure, the ileum of ovine and caprine animals of all ages should be added to the list of specified risk materials.
(6) As the condition of heads depends mainly on their careful handling and a safe sealing of the frontal shot hole and the foramen magnum, control systems must be in place in the slaughterhouses and in the specifically authorised cutting plants.
(9) Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 should therefore be amended accordingly.
Article 1
This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
amending Council Regulation (EC) No 2223/96 with respect to the time limit for transmission of the main aggregates of national accounts, to the derogations concerning the transmission of the main aggregates of national accounts and to the transmission of employment data in hours worked
