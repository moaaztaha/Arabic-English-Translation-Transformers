This Regulation shall enter into force on 1 July 1986.
Whereas under these arrangements the requirement, be it purely formal, in intra-Community trade of an import licence or any similar procedure is prohibited;
Whereas the establishment of a common commercial policy is not yet complete; whereas the measures applied by the Member States in respect of some products from third countries have not yet been replaced by uniform common rules;
Whereas the Single European Act provides for the establishment, as from 1 January 1993, of an area without internal frontiers in which goods, services and capital will be able to move freely; whereas this implies, on the one hand, that the disparities still existing among commercial policies applied by the Member States shall be progressively eliminated or reduced and, on the other, that the Commission must be fully aware of these objectives when assessing the need to authorize measures pursuant to Article 115 of the Treaty; Whereas, by its Decision 80/47/EEC of 20 December 1979 on surveillance and protective measures which Member States may be authorized to take in respect of imports of certain products originating in third countries and put into free circulation in another Member State (1) the Commission established certain criteria and procedures to be followed in implementing Article 115 of the Treaty;
Whereas, should a Member State request authorization to apply protective measures, the time limit for the issue of import documents must be extended if the volume covered by the applications for documents pending reaches a certain level;
Whereas the measures adopted pursuant to Article 115 of the Treaty, by virtue of the fact that they not only constitute an exception from the provisions of Articles 9 and 30 of the Treaty but also hamper the establishment of a common commercial policy as laid down in Article 113 of the Treaty, must be interpreted and applied strictly; whereas, to take account of this and also of the objectives laid down by the Single European Act, such measures should be applied only for a limited period and where the gravity of the situation so warrants;
Article 1
Article 2
2. As a general rule the Commission will not give the authorization referred to in paragraph 1 unless:

- originating in all third countries,
The information required under subparagraphs (c) and (d) shall cover the two preceding years and the current year. Where this information cannot be supplied with the accuracy required or cannot be supplied in time, the Member State's request shall contain the information available.

- its heading number in the Common Customs Tariff and the NIMEXE code;
(f) supporting evidence that the product is in free circulation: if the products are not yet in free circulation on the date when the application for importation is made or if the supporting evidence cannot be provided by this date, the import document shall be granted but its validity shall be limited to one month following receipt of the document by the applicant.
1. Where imports into a Member State of a product referred to in Article 1 give rise to economic difficulties, the Member State in question may take protective measures after obtaining authorization by the Commission, which shall determine the conditions and details of such measures.
(a) the exporting Member State;
- originating in the third country concerned, broken down between direct imports and imports of products in free circulation,
- originating in the Community;
(f) at the Commission's request, the measures taken or proposed to remedy the situation of the sector in question.
- the maximum period for the issue of import documents shall be increased to 10 working days from the date of the application by the importer,
7. The Commission shall decide on the Member State's request within five working days of its receipt.
1.

Article 6
Article 7
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 100 thereof,
Whereas Directive 70/156/EEC (3), as last amended by the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal, laid down the Community type-approval procedure for vehicles built in compliance with the technical requirements set out in specific directives and also the list of vehicle parts and characteristics covered by those directives;
Whereas, in order to apply the said type-approval procedure correctly, control of the conformity of production should include verification of the arrangements which have been made by the manufacturer to ensure that vehicles, separate technical units or components in production conform to the approved type;
Whereas, in cases where the separate directives provide that a separate technical unit must bear the type-approval number, it should not be mandatory that each unit be accompanied by a certificate of conformity; whereas a manufacturer of a separate technical unit should in any case be required to provide information concerning any restrictions on its use and conditions relating to the fitting of the unit,
Directive 70/156/EEC is hereby amended as follows:
- "separate technical unit" means a device, subject to the requirements of a separate directive, intended to be part of a vehicle which may be type-approved separately but only in relation to one or more specified types of vehicles,
For the purposes of this Directive:
- "standardtypegodkendelse" in Danish law,
- "homologacion de tipo" in Spanish law,

A Member State which has granted type-approval shall take the necessary measures to verify, in so far as is necessary and if need be in cooperation with the competent authorities of the other Member States, that the arrangements referred to in paragraph 2 continue to be adequate and that production models conform to the approved type. Verification that production models conform to the approved type shall be limited to spot checks, unless specified otherwise in the separate directives.
1. The competent authorities of each Member State shall, within one month, send the competent authorities of the other Member States a copy of the type-approval certificate for each vehicle type which they approve or refuse to approve.
4. Article 7 (2) is replaced by the following:
5. Article 8 is replaced by the following:
Where a failure to conform has been established, the competent authorities of the Member State which granted type-approval shall take the measures outlined in paragraph 1.
The Commission shall be kept informed and shall, where necessary, hold appropriate consultations for the purpose of reaching a settlement.'
1. Where the separate directives make express provision for so doing, EEC type-approval may also be granted to types of systems or parts of vehicles which form a separate technical unit and to components in accordance with Articles 3 to 9 and 14.
4. The holder of an EEC type-approval certificate which, in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 2, includes restrictions on its use, shall deliver with each unit or component manufactured detailed information on these restrictions and shall indicate any conditions for fitting it.'
Article 2
1. Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by 1 October 1988. They shall forthwith inform the Commission thereof.
This Directive is addressed to the Member States.

Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Fishery Resources,
Regulation (EEC) No 3440/84 is hereby amended as follows:

Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),
Whereas the Community is to adopt measures designed to establish the internal market progressively over a period expiring on 31 December 1992;
Whereas the ultimate aim is to ensure that veterinary checks are carried out at the place of dispatch only; whereas the attainment of this objective implies the harmonization of the basic requirements relating to the safeguarding of public health and animal health;
Whereas in the State of destination spot veterinary checks could be carried out at the place of destination; whereas, however, in the event of a serious presumption of irregularity, the veterinary check could be carried out while the goods are in transit;
Whereas provision must be made for protective measures; whereas in this area, especially for reasons of effectiveness, responsibility must rest firstly with the Member State of dispatch; whereas the Commission must be able to act speedily, in particular by way of on-the-spot visits and adopting measures appropriate to the situation.
Whereas the provisions of existing Directives should be adapted to the new rules laid down in this Directive;
HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:
Article 2
2. 'trade' means trade between Member States in goods within the meaning of Article 9 (2) of the Treaty;
5. 'official veterinarian' means the veterinarian appointed by the competent central authority of the Member State.

- for an approved intermediary who divides up the batches or for a commercial undertaking with many branches, or any establishment not subject to permanent supervision, the latter must check, before the batch is divided up or marketed, that the said marks, certificate, or documents referred to in the first indent are present and notify the competent authority of any irregularity or anomaly,
2. Without prejudice to Article 4, where the Community standards laid down by Community rules have not been set and in the case provided for in Article 14, the Member State of destination may require, with due regard for the general provisions of the Treaty, that the establishment of origin must apply the standards in force under the national rules of that Member State. The Member State of origin shall ensure that the product in question comply with those requirements.
(b) shall keep a register in which such deliveries are recorded;

Article 4
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2),
Whereas, if distortions are to be avoided, such abolition implies in the case of value added tax, not only a uniform tax base but also a number of rates and rate levels which are sufficiently close as between Member States; whereas it is therefore necessary to amend Directive 77/388/EEC (4);
Article 1
'3. (a) From 1 January 1993 Member States shall apply a standard rate which, until 31 December 1996, may not be less than 15 %.
(b) Member States may apply a reduced rate to supplies of natural gas and electricity provided that no risk of distortion of competition exists. A Member State intending to apply such a rate must, before doing so, inform the Commission. The Commission shall give a decision on the existence of a risk of distortion of competition. If the Commission has not taken that decision within three months of the receipt of the information a risk of distortion of competition is deemed not to exist.
Until 31 December 1994, those Member States currently applying a reduced rate may continue to do so; those currently applying a standard rate may not apply a reduced rate. This will allow a two-year postponement of the application of the standard rate.
2. the first sentence of Article 12 (4) shall be deleted;
4. Article 28 (2) is replaced by the following:
Member States shall adopt the measures necessary to ensure the determination of own resources relating to these operations.

Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),
Whereas the medium and long-term prospects for the Community and world agricultural markets require certain instruments of the common agricultural policy to be revised in order to restore market balance; whereas such adjustments, directed principally at increasing the flexibility of the market-support instruments, require the operators concerned to change their economic behaviour to take better account of the actual market situation;
Whereas to support certain activities of inter-branch organizations which are of particular interest in the light of the current rules concerning the market organization for the tobacco sector, provision should be made for the rules adopted by an inter-branch organization for its members to be extended, subject to certain conditions, to all non-member producers and groups in one or more regions; whereas non-members should also be made liable to pay all or part of the subscriptions intended to cover the non-administrative costs incurred in pursuing such activities; whereas this procedure should be implemented in a way which guarantees the rights of the socio-economic groups concerned, in particular the rights of the consumer;
Whereas there should be provision for publication, at the beginning of each year, of a list of the organizations recognized during the previous year, a list of the organizations whose recognition has been withdrawn during the same period and the rules which have been extended with an indication of their scope, for the information of the Member States and other interested parties,

The measure may not take effect until two months have elapsed from the date of publication.
This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.
Whereas, moreover, it has been observed in recent years that consumers are tending to attach greater importance to the quality of foodstuffs rather than to quantity; whereas this quest for specific products generates a growing demand for agricultural products or foodstuffs with an identifiable geographical origin;
Whereas the desire to protect agricultural products or foodstuffs which have an identifiable geographical origin has led certain Member States to introduce 'registered designations of origin`; whereas these have proved successful with producers, who have secured higher incomes in return for a genuine effort to improve quality, and with consumers, who can purchase high quality products with guarantees as to the method of production and origin;
Whereas the scope of this Regulation is limited to certain agricultural products and foodstuffs for which a link between product or foodstuff characteristics and geographical origin exists; whereas, however, this scope could be enlarged to encompass other products or foodstuffs;
Whereas to enjoy protection in every Member State geographical indications and designations of origin must be registered at Community level; whereas entry in a register should also provide information to those involved in trade and to consumers;
Whereas provision should be made for trade with third countries offering equivalent guarantees for the issue and inspection of geographical indications or designations of origin granted on their territory;
Article 1
Annex I may be amended in accordance with the procedure set out in Article 15.

- there are inspection arrangements to ensure that those conditions are adhered to.
7. In order to be eligible for the derogation provided for in paragraph 4, applications for registration must be lodged within two years of the entry into force of this Regulation.
For the purposes of this Regulation, a 'name that has become generic` means the name of an agricultural product or a foodstuff which, although it relates to the place or the region where this product or foodstuff was originally produced or marketed, has become the common name of an agricultural product or a foodstuff.
- the existing situation in other Member States,
2. A name may not be registered as a designation of origin or a geographical indication where it conflicts with the name of a plant variety or an animal breed and as a result is likely to mislead the public as to the true origin of the product.
1. To be eligible to use a protected designation of origin (PDO) or a protected geographical indication (PGI) an agricultural product or foodstuff must comply with a specification.
(b) a description of the agricultural product or foodstuff including the raw materials, if appropriate, and principal physical, chemical, microbiological and/or organoleptic characteristics of the product or the foodstuff;
(e) a description of the method of obtaining the agricultural product or foodstuff and, if appropriate, the authentic and unvarying local methods;

The Commission shall inform the Member State concerned of its findings.
4. The Commission shall publish in the Official Journal of the European Communities:
5. If, in the light of the investigation provided for in paragraph 1, the Commission concludes that the name does not qualify for protection, it shall decide, in accordance with the procedure provided for in Article 15, not to proceed with the publication provided for in paragraph 2 of this Article.
1. Within six months of the date of publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities referred to in Article 6 (2), any Member State may object to the registration.
4. A statement of objection shall be admissible only if it:
- or indicates the features which demonstrate that the name whose registration is applied for is generic in nature.
(b) no agreement is reached, the Commission shall take a decision in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 15, having regard to traditional fair practice and of the actual likelihood of confusion. Should it decide to proceed with registration, the Commission shall carry out publication in accordance with Article 6 (4).
Article 9
The Commission may, however, decide, under the procedure laid down in Article 15, not to apply the Article 6 procedure in the case of a minor amendment.
2. An inspection structure may comprise one or more designated inspection authorities and/or private bodies approved for that purpose by the Member State. Member States shall send the Commission lists of the authorities and/or bodies approved and their respective powers. The Commission shall publish those particulars in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
As from 1 January 1998, in order to be approved by the Member States for the purpose of this Regulation, private bodies must fulfil the requirements laid down in standard EN 45011 of 26 June 1989.
6. The Member States shall adopt the measures necessary to ensure that a producer who complies with this Regulation has access to the inspection system.
1. Any Member State may submit that a condition laid down in the product specification of an agricultural product or foodstuff covered by a protected name has not been met.
4. The Commission shall examine the application by consulting the Member States concerned. Where appropriate, having consulted the committee referred to in Article 15, the Commission shall take the necessary steps. These may include cancellation of the registration.
- the third country concerned is prepared to provide protection equivalent to that available in the Community to corresponding agricultural products for foodstuffs coming from the Community.
Article 13
(b) any misuse, imitation or evocation, even if the true origin of the product is indicated or if the protected name is translated or accompanied by an expression such as 'style`, 'type`, 'method`, 'as produced in`, 'imitation` or similar;
Where a registered name contains within it the name of an agricultural product or foodstuff which is considered generic, the use of that generic name on the appropriate agricultural product or foodstuff shall not be considered to be contrary to (a) or (b) in the first subparagraph.
- the labelling clearly indicates the true origin of the product.
Article 14
This paragraph shall also apply where the application for registration of a trade mark was lodged before the date of publication of the application for registration provided for in Article 6 (2), provided that that publication occured before the trade mark was registered.
The representative of the Commission shall submit to the committee a draft of the measures to be taken. The committee shall deliver its opinion on the draft within a time limit which the chairman may lay down according to the urgency of the matter. The opinion shall be delivered by the majority laid down in Article 148 (2) of the Treaty in the case of decisions which the Council is required to adopt on a proposal from the Commission. The votes of the representatives of the Member States within the committee shall be weighted in the manner set out in that Article. The chairman shall not vote.
If, on the expiry of a period of three months from the date of referral to the Council, the Council has not acted, the proposed measures shall be adopted by the Commission.

Whereas the aid introduced by Council Regulation (EEC) No 845/72 of 24 April 1972 laying down special measures to encourage silkworm rearing (2), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2059/92 (3), is granted for boxes of eggs from which worms have successfully been reared; whereas, therefore, the event by which the economic objective has been attained can, on average, be deemed to have taken place on 1 August of each marketing year; whereas that date may therefore be taken as the operative event for the agricultural conversion rate applicable to aid for silkworms;
Whereas Article 11 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 1068/93 provides for the agricultural conversion rate valid at the beginning of the marketing year to be used for aid per hectare for flax and hemp; whereas Article 10 (3) of that Regulation provides that the operative event for private storage aid for flax and hemp fibres is to be the first day of the contract for each lot concerned; whereas, therefore, Regulations (EEC) No 876/75 and (EEC) No 1426/86 can be repealed;
Article 2
Regulations (EEC) No 876/75 and (EEC) No 1426/86 are hereby repealed.
COMMISSION REGULATION (EEC) No 2040/93 of 27 July 1993 determining the amount of production aid for potatoes for human consumption in Madeira and the amounts of production aid for seed potatoes and endives in the Azores fixed in ecus by the Council and reduced as a result of monetary realignments

Whereas the delivery of down-graded eggs should be restricted to food industry undertakings approved in accordance with Council Directive 89/437/EEC of 20 June 1989 on hygiene and health problems affecting the production and the placing on the market of egg products (3) in order to assure proper handling of such eggs;
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
2. Article 4 (1) point (a) shall be replaced by the following:
4. Article 7 (a) shall be replaced by the following:
'(a) the name or the business name, and address of the undertaking which has packed the eggs or had them packed; the name, business name or the trade mark used by that undertaking, which may be a trade mark used collectively by a number of undertakings, may be shown if it contains no statement or symbol incompatible with this Regulation relating to the quality or freshness of the eggs, to the type of farming used for their production or to the origin of the eggs;'
7. Article 10 (2) point (e) shall be replaced by the following:
'(2) in the case of loose egg sales, the identification number of the packing centre which graded the eggs, or in the case of imported eggs the third country of origin, and the date of minimum durability followed by the appropriate storage recommendations shall also be indicated'.
Article 3
COUNCIL REGULATION (EEC) No 2847/93 of 12 October 1993 establishing a control system applicable to the common fisheries policy
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),
Whereas, to achieve this aim, it is necessary to include rules for the monitoring of conservation and resource management measures, structural measures and measures on the common organization of the market, and certain provisions to deal with failure to carry out these measures, which must apply to the entire fisheries sector from the producer to the consumer;
Whereas experience gained in the application of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2241/87 of 23 July 1987 establishing certain control measures for fishing activities (5) has shown that there is a need to strengthen control of the application of the rules governing conservation of fishery resources;
Whereas, to ensure that all catches and landings are kept under surveillance, Member States must monitor in all maritime waters the activities of Community vessels and all related activities allowing verification of the implementation of the rules concerning the common fisheries policy;
Whereas the implementation of pilot projects applicable to certain categories of vessels by the Member States in cooperation with the Commission will make it possible for the Council to decide, before 1 January 1996, whether a satellite surveillance system or an alternative system should be implemented;
Whereas it is essential to clarify and confirm at the time of landing the information contained in the logbooks; whereas, to this end, it is necessary that those involved in the landing and marketing of catches should declare the quantities landed, transshipped, offered for sale of purchased;
Whereas limitations on catches must be managed at both Member State and Community level; whereas Member States should register landings and notify them to the Commission by computer transmission; whereas therefore it is necessary to provide for exceptions from this obligation for small quantities landed, the computer transmission of which would constitute a disproportionate administrative and financial burden for the authorities of the Member States;
Whereas the management of the collection and treatment of date requires the creation of computerised data bases enabling, in particular, cross checking of data; whereas therefore the Commission and its agents must have access to these data bases by computer transmission to carry out verification of the data;
Whereas it is necessary to repair the prejudice suffered by a Member State which has not exhausted its quota, its allocation of part of a stock or group of stocks when the fishery has been closed following the exhaustion of a TAC; whereas to this end a system of compensation should be provided for;
Whereas one of the main aims of the common fisheries policy is to adjust fishing capacities to available resources; whereas Article 11 of Regulation (EEC) No 3760/92 stipulates that it is the task of the Council to set the objectives and strategies for the restructuring of fishing effort; whereas it is also necessary that compliance with the measures on the common organization of the market be assured, in particular by persons to whom these measures apply; whereas, therefore, it is vital that each Member State carry out, in addition to the financial checks already provided for in Community rules, technical checks to ensure that the provisions set by the Council are complied with;
Whereas the action taken following infringements may differ from one Member State to another; causing fishermen to feel unfairly treated; whereas the absence of dissuasive sanctions in certain Member States reduced the effectiveness of controls and whereas, in the light of these observations, Member States should take all the necessary non-discriminatory measures to guard against and prosecute irregularities, particularly by establishing a roster of sanctions which effectively deprive the wrong-doers of the commercial gain resulting from their infringements;
Whereas for certain measures laid down by this Regulation it is appropriate to provide for detailed rules of implementation;
Whereas Regulation (EEC) No 2241/87 should be repealed, exception being made, however, for Article 5 which should remain in force, pending the adoption of the lists referred to in Article 6 (2) of this Regulation;
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:

Article 7
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2),
Whereas it is necessary to extend the scope of Regulation (EEC) No 2299/89 and to clarify its provisions and it is appropriate to take these measures at Community level to ensure that the objectives of the Regulation are met in all Member States;
Whereas non-scheduled air services are of major importance in the territory of the Community;
Whereas it is desirable to treat like products equally and to ensure fair competition between both kinds of air transport products and the neutral dissemination of information to the consumer;

'Article 1 Unless this Regulation provides otherwise, the rates of duty in the Common Customs Tariff shall apply to the following products:
This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),
Whereas the Community is seriously concerned by shipping casualties with loss of life;
Whereas safety of human life at sea may be effectively enhanced by applying the ISM Code strictly and on a mandatory basis;
Whereas strict and mandatory application of the ISM Code is required to ensure the establishment and proper maintenance of safety management systems by companies operating seagoing ro-ro passenger ferries both at ship and at company level;
Whereas the safety of ships is the primary responsibility of flag States; whereas Member States can ensure compliance with adequate safety management rules by ferries flying their flag and companies operating them; whereas the only way to ensure the safety of all ro-ro ferries, irrespective of their flag, operating or wishing to operate on a regular service from their ports is for the Member States to require effective compliance with safety rules as a condition for operating on a regular service from their ports;
Whereas Member States might find it necessary to delegate or rely upon specialized bodies in order to fulfil their obligations pursuant to this Regulation; whereas the appropriate way of ensuring a uniform and adequate level of control is to require that such bodies should only be those which meet the requirements of Council Directive 94/57/EC of 22 November 1994 on common rules and standards for ship inspection and survey organizations and for the relevant activities of maritime administrations (1);
Whereas the rapid introduction of these safety rules raises specific technical and administative problems for Greece because of the very large number of companies established in Greece operating ferries under the Greek flag and exclusively between Greek ports; whereas a derogation of limited duration to cover this situation should therefore be granted bearing in mind in addition that regular passenger and ferry services between Greek ports have been excluded until 1 January 2004 from the freedom to provide services granted by Council Regulation (EEC) No 3577/92 of 7 December 1992 applying the principle of freedom to provide services to maritime transport within Member States (maritime cabotage) (2),
The purpose of this Regulation is to enhance the safe management, safe operation and pollution prevention of ro-ro passenger ferries operating to or from ports of the Member States of the Community on a regular service by ensuring that companies operating ro-ro ferries comply with the ISM Code through:
Article 2
(b) 'regular service' means a series of ro-ro ferry crossings operated so as to serve traffic between the same two or more points, either:
(c) 'company' means the owner of a ro-ro ferry or any other organization or person such as the manager, or the bareboat charterer, who has assumed responsibility for operating the ro-ro ferry from the owner;
(f) 'administration' means the Government of the State whose flag the ro-ro ferry is entitled to fly;
(i) 'sheltered waters' means areas where the annual probability of the significant wave height exceeding 1,5 m is less than 10 %, and in which a ro-ro ferry is at no time more than six nautical miles from a place of refuge where shipwrecked persons can land.
Article 4
Article 5
For the purposes of paragraph 13.2 of the ISM Code, a Member State may only issue documents of compliance for a company which has its principal place of business on its own territory. Prior to such issue, the Member States shall consult the administration of the States whose flag the ro-ro ferries of that company are entitled to fly, if that administration is not that of the issuing Member State.
5. For the purposes of this Regulation, and in particular Article 6, each Member State shall accept a document of compliance or a safety management certificate issued by the administration of any other Member State or by a recognized organization acting on its behalf.
Article 6
Where a Member State considers that a company, notwithstanding the fact that it holds a document of compliance, cannot operate a ro-ro ferry on a regular service to or from its ports on the grounds that there is a risk of serious danger to safety of life or property, or the environment, the operation of such service may be suspended until such time as the danger is removed.
In order to take account of the general terms of the ISM Code, the Commission shall review the implementation of this Regulation three years after its entry into force and propose any appropriate measures.
(a) the definition of the 'ISM Code' in Article 2;
Article 10
3. (a) The Commission shall adopt the measures envisaged if they are in accordance with the opinion of the committee.
Article 11
COUNCIL DECISION of 25 June 1996 on improving Community agricultural statistics (96/411/EC)

Whereas national adaptations have to be coordinated at Community level, in order to ensure that:
(c) methodological studies by different Member States into efficient ways of meeting the new information needs are appropriate;
Whereas the best means of achieving this coordination is within a formal structure which allows the technical constraints and preferences to be considered collectively and choices made which reconcile national and Community interests;
Whereas provision should be made for a possible extension of this Decision in the context of the next framework programme for priority actions in the field of statistical information relating to the period after 1997;

Article 4
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2),
(2) Whereas Council Directive 88/299/EEC (6) lays down the conditions for applying the derogations provided for in Article 7 of Directive 88/146/EEC from the prohibition on trade in certain categories of animals and their meat;
(5) Whereas the results of an enquiry conducted by the Commission in the Member States from 1990 to 1992 show that beta-agonists are widely available in the livestock-rearing sector, leading to their illegal use;
(8) Whereas, moreover, it is necessary to ensure that all consumers are able to acquire meat and foodstuffs derived therefrom under the same conditions of supply and that those products correspond as closely as possible to their concerns and expectations; whereas, given consumer sensitivity, this can only bring about an increase in the consumption of the products in question;
(11) Whereas, furthermore, live animals so treated for therapeutic or zootechnical purposes and the meat from such animals should not as a general rule be traded, since this could impair the effectiveness of the control arrangements of the scheme as a whole; whereas, however, derogations from the prohibition may, subject to certain conditions, be provided for in respect of intra-Community trade and imports from third countries of animals intended for breeding and breeding animals at the end of their reproductive life;
(14) Whereas Directives 81/602/EEC, 88/146/EEC and 88/299/EEC should be repealed;

Where the results of checks carried out in a Member State show failure to comply with the requirements of this Directive in the country of origin of the animals or products, the competent authority of that Member State shall have recourse to Council Directive 89/608/EEC of 21 November 1989 on mutual assistance between the administrative authorities of the Member States and cooperation between the latter and the Commission to ensure the correct application of legislation on veterinary and zootechnical matters (17).
2. Member States shall also prohibit the importation from third countries on any of the lists referred to in paragraph 1 of:

(2) Whereas in its resolution of 15 January 1985 on the improvement of energy-saving programmes in the Member States (4) the Council invited the Member States to pursue and where necessary increase their efforts to promote the more rational use of energy by the further development of integrated energy-saving policies;
(5) Whereas it is appropriate to take as a base a high level of protection in proposals for the approximation of the provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action in Member States concerning health, safety, environmental protection and consumer protection; whereas this Directive ensures a high level of protection for both the environment and the consumer, in aiming at a significant improvement of the energy efficiency of these appliances;
(8) Whereas, furthermore, Council Decision 89/364/EEC of 5 June 1989 on a Community action programme for improving the efficiency of electricity use (5) has as its twin objectives to encourage consumers to favour appliances and equipment with high electrical efficiency and to improve the efficiency of appliances and equipment;
(11) Whereas the energy efficiency measures incorporated in the most up-to-date models of refrigeration appliances available do not increase their production costs excessively and can pay for their initial cost through electricity savings within a few years or even more rapidly; whereas this calculation does not take into account the added benefit of the external costs of electricity generation thereby avoided, such as emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other pollutants;
(14) Whereas this Directive, which is aimed at eliminating technical barriers with regard to improving the energy efficiency of household refrigeration appliances, must follow the 'new approach` established by the Council resolution of 7 May 1985 on a new approach to technical harmonization and standards (9) which specifically lays down that legislative harmonization is limited to the adoption, by means of directives, of the essential requirements with which products put on the market must conform;
(17) Whereas in the interest of international trade, international standards should be used wherever appropriate; whereas the electricity consumption of a refrigeration appliance is defined by the European Committee for Standardization Standard EN 153 of July 1995 which is based on an international standard;
HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:
Article 2
Article 3
3. (a) Where refrigeration appliances are subject to other directives covering other aspects which also provide for affixing of the 'CE` marking, the latter shall indicate that the refrigeration appliances in question are also presumed, unless evidence to the contrary exists, to conform to the provisions of those other directives.

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (2),
Whereas the difference in national laws on the systems for the commercial operation of inland waterway transport, does not make for the smooth functioning of the internal market in this sector; whereas, therefore, common provisions should be introduced at Community level for the whole of the inland waterways market, in accordance with the Council Resolution of 24 October 1994 on structural improvements in inland waterway transport (4);
Whereas, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, it is both necessary and adequate to set a uniform timetable at Community level for the gradual liberalization of the market, while leaving with the Member States the responsibility for putting such liberalization into effect;
Article 1
(b) 'carrier` shall mean an owner or an operator of one or more inland waterway vessels;
Article 2

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Opinion of the European Parliament (2),
Whereas potato and tomato production occupies an important place in Community agriculture; whereas the potato and tomato yield is constantly threatened by harmful organisms;
Whereas one of the harmful organisms on potatoes and tomatoes is Ralstonia solanacearum (Smith) Yabuuchi et al., the pathogenic agent of the potato brown rot disease and of bacterial wilt in potatoes and tomatoes; whereas disease outbreaks caused by this pathogen have occurred in some parts of the Community and some limited sources of infection still exist;
Whereas the measures have to take into account that systematic official surveys are necessary to locate the pathogen; whereas such surveys should include inspection procedures and, where appropriate, given that under certain environmental circumstances the disease can remain latent and unobserved both in the growing crop of potatoes and in stored potato tubers, should include sampling and testing procedures; whereas spread of the pathogen within the growing crop is not the most important factor, but whereas the pathogen can spread by surface water and certain associated wild solanaceous plants, and therefore the irrigation of potato and tomato crops using contaminated water appears to pose a risk for infection of such crops; whereas also the pathogen can exist through the winter in self-sown (volunteer) potato and tomato plants and these may be a source of infection being carried from one season to the next; whereas the pathogen is spread also by the contamination of potatoes through contact with infected potatoes and through contact with planting, harvesting and handling equipment or transport and storage containers which have become contaminated with the organism by previous contact with infected potatoes;
Whereas, for the determination of the details of such general measures, as well as for those stricter or additional measures taken by Member States to prevent the introduction of the pathogen into their territory, it is desirable for Member States to cooperate closely with the Commission within the Standing Committee of Plant Health (hereinafter referred to as 'the Committee`),

4. The following provision may be adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 16a of Directive 77/93/EEC:
1. If official or officially supervised laboratory testing, using, for the listed plant material, the relevant method set out in Annex II or, in all other cases, any other officially approved method, confirms the presence of the organism in a sample taken pursuant to this Directive, the responsible official bodies of a Member State, having regard to sound scientific principles, the biology of the organism and the particular production, marketing and processing systems of the host plants of the organism in that Member State, shall:
(ii) designate as contaminated the listed plant material, consignment and/or lot from which the sample was taken, and the machinery, vehicle, vessel, store, or units thereof, and any other objects including packaging material which have been in contact with the listed plant material from which the sample was taken; also designate as contaminated, where appropriate, the field(s), unit(s) of protected crop production and place(s) of production from which the listed plant material was harvested and from which the sample was taken; and for those samples taken in the growing season, designate as contaminated the field(s), place(s) of production, and, where appropriate, unit(s) of protected crop production from which the sample was taken, and,
(b) for crops of host plants other than those mentioned under point (a) where production of the listed plant material is identified at risk,
(iii) determine the probable contamination and demarcate a zone in accordance with points (a)(iii) and (iv), respectively, in relation to production of the listed plant material;
(ii) designate as contaminated the surface water from which the sample(s) was taken, to the extent appropriate and on the basis of the investigation under point (i); and
Member States shall at the same time submit to the Commission the additional notification set out at point 4 of Annex V. The details of the notification under this subparagraph shall immediately be submitted to the members of the Committee.
1. Member States shall prescribe that the listed plant material designated to be contaminated under Article 5(1)(a)(ii) may not be planted and that, under the control and approval of their responsible official bodies, it shall be subjected to one of the provisions of point 1 of Annex VI, such that it is established that there is no identifiable risk of the organism spreading.
4. Without prejudice to the measures implemented under paragraphs 1, 2 and 3, Member States shall prescribe that, in the zone demarcated under Article 5(1)(a)(iv) and (c)(iii), a series of measures, as specified in points 4.1 and 4.2 of Annex VI, shall be implemented. Details of these measures shall be notified annually to the other Member States and to the Commission. The details of this notification may be submitted to the Committee.
The aforesaid testing shall be carried out by a Member State:

Whereas Regulation (EEC) No 1722/93 of the Commission of 30 June 1993 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulations (EEC) No 1766/92 and (EEC) No 1418/76 concerning production refunds in the cereals and rice sectors respectively (5), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1516/95 (6), envisages, for the calculating method of the production refund, a differentiation between starches containing maize, wheat, potatoes and rice on the one hand and starches containing barley and oats on the other; whereas experience has shown that the fixing of a specific amount for the product containing barley and oats is no longer necessary and that the single amount of the refund can hence apply to any starch without risk of inadequate compensation;
Whereas the regulation stipulates currently that Member States notify each month to the Commission the statistical data covering at the same time the quantities of starch having benefited from the production refund and the products for which starch was used; whereas it appeared that this rhythm of information is too frequent and that it is advisable to replace it by a quarterly notification;
'Article 3
(i) the maize market price in the Community, valid during the five days preceding the day of fixing, taking into account the price levels noted for the wheat; and
3. The refund payable shall be that calculated in accordance with paragraph 2 and multiplied by the coefficient indicated to Annex II which corresponds to the CN code of the starch actually used for the manufacture of the approved products.
'3. The refund certificate shall include the information referred to in Article 5(2) as well as the rate of the refund payable and the final day of validity of the certificate which shall be the last day of the fifth month following the month of issue.
However, where any of the quantities of starch quoted on the certificate is processed during the cereals marketing year following that in which the application was received, the refund payable for that starch which is processed in the new marketing year shall be adjusted according to the difference between the intervention price applicable during the month of delivery of the restitution certificate, and that applicable in the month of processing, multiplied by a coefficient of 1,60. The conversion rate to be used to express the amount of the refund in national currency shall be that valid on the day on which the starch was processed.`
4. Article 10(4) is supplemented by following subparagraph:
'Within three months from the end of each quarter of the calendar year, Member States shall notify the Commission of the type, quantities and origin of the starch (maize, wheat, potatoes, barley, oats or rice) for which refunds have been paid and the type and quantities of products for which the starch has been used.`

Whereas however certain components, in particular straw and manure, can currently not be obtained in sufficient quantities from organic production; whereas therefore it is appropriate to foresee an appropriate transitional period to permit producers to adapt to the new requirements;
Whereas the length of the transitional period may be reviewed in view of any developments with regard to the availability of straw and manure from organic production;
Article 1
1. This Regulation shall enter into force on 1 December 1998.
- and/or products referred to in point 5.2 of the Annex, not from holdings producing according to the organic production method, but satisfying, where relevant, the requirements referred to in Annex II, Part A of Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91,

Having regard to the opinion of the Commission (3),
(2) Whereas Article 19.2 of the Statute requires the Council to define, inter alia, the basis for minimum reserves and the maximum permissible ratios between those reserves and their basis;
(5) Whereas, in order to be effective as an instrument for the performance of money market management and monetary control functions, the system for the imposition of minimum reserves needs to be structured so that the ECB has the ability and flexibility to impose reserve requirements within the context of, and dependent upon, changing economic and financial conditions among participating Member States; whereas in this respect the ECB must have the flexibility to react to new payment technologies such as the development of electronic money; whereas the ECB may impose minimum reserves on liabilities resulting from off-balance-sheet items, in particular those that are either individually or in combination with other on-balance-sheet or off-balance-sheet items, comparable with liabilities recorded on the balance sheet, in order to limit the possibilities of circumvention;
(8) Whereas the ESCB and the ECB have been entrusted with the task of preparing the monetary policy instruments to allow for their full operation in the third stage of Economic and Monetary Union (hereinafter referred to as 'Stage Three`); whereas an essential element of preparation is the adoption, ahead of Stage Three, of ECB regulations requiring institutions to hold minimum reserves as from 1 January 1999; whereas it is desirable to inform market participants during 1998 of the detailed provisions which the ECB may deem necessary to adopt for the implementation of the minimum reserves system; whereas it is therefore necessary to provide the ECB from the date of entry into force of this Regulation with a regulatory power;
2. 'national central bank` shall mean the central bank of a participating Member State;
5. 'sanctions` shall mean fines, periodic penalty payments, penalty interest and non-interest-bearing deposits.
The ECB may, on a non-discriminatory basis, exempt institutions from minimum reserves in accordance with criteria established by the ECB.
1. The basis for minimum reserves which the ECB may require institutions to hold according to Article 19.1 of the Statute shall include, subject to the provisions specified in paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Article:
(iii) fully or partly liabilities which are owed to any other institution according to modalities which shall be specified by the ECB, and
3. The ECB may, on a non-discriminatory basis, allow the deduction of specific types of assets from categories of liabilities forming part of the basis for minimum reserves.
1. Reserve ratios, which the ECB may specify according to Article 19.1 of the Statute, shall not exceed 10 % of any relevant liabilities forming part of the basis for minimum reserves but may be 0 %.

(c) take copies or extracts from such books and records; and
4. The ECB may delegate to the national central banks the execution of the rights to which paragraphs 1 to 3 refer. In accordance with the first indent of Article 34.1 of the Statute, the ECB shall be empowered to specify further in a regulation the conditions under which the right to verify may be exercised.
1. Where an institution fails to hold all or part of the minimum reserves imposed in accordance with this Regulation and ECB regulations or decisions associated herewith, the ECB may impose either of the following sanctions:
2. Whenever a sanction is imposed in accordance with paragraph 1, the principles and procedures set out in Regulation (EC) No 2532/98 shall apply. However, Article 2(1) and (3) and Article 3(1), (2), (3) and (4) of that Regulation shall not be applicable, and the periods referred to in Article 3(6), (7) and (8) thereof shall be reduced to fifteen days.

(10) Whereas the checks on conformity and the ensuing clearance decisions will therefore no longer be linked to the implementation of the budget in a particular financial year; whereas the maximum period to which the consequences to be drawn from the checks on conformity may be applied must be determined; whereas, however, the pluriannual character of rural development measures does not allow the application of such a maximum period;
(13) Whereas information technology needs to be used as fully as possible for producing the information to be sent to the Commission; whereas, when carrying out checks, the Commission just have full and immediate access to information on expenditure held in both documents and electronic files;
(16) Whereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 729/70 of 21 April 1970 on the financing of the common agricultural policy(7) has been substantially amended on several occasions; whereas, now that new amendments are being made to the said Regulation, it is desirable, in order to clarify matters, that the provisions in question should be recast,

The sums recovered shall be paid to the accredited paying agencies and deducted by them from the expenditure financed by the Fund. The interest on sums recovered or paid late shall be paid into the Fund.
1. Member States shall make available to the Commission all information required for the proper working of the Fund and shall take all suitable measures to facilitate the supervision which the Commission may consider necessary to undertake within the framework of the management of Community financing, including inspections on the spot.

amending Annex IV to Council Directive 90/539/EEC on animal health conditions governing intra-Community trade in, and imports from third countries of poultry and hatching eggs and amending Decision 96/482/EC laying down animal health conditions and veterinary certificates for the importation of poultry and hatching eggs other than ratites and eggs thereof from third countries including animal health measures to be applied after such importation
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to Council Directive 91/496/EEC of 15 July 1991 laying down the principles governing the organisation of veterinary checks on animals entering the Community and amending Directives 89/662/EEC, 90/425/EEC and 90/675/EEC(3), as last amended by Directive 96/43/EC(4), and in particular Article 10 thereof,
(2) Given the experience gained during the application of the measures provided for, the conditions under which day-old chicks originating from hatching eggs which have been imported from third countries are traded within the Community should be modified. The modification should enable Member States to dispatch day-old chicks to hodlings located in another Member State ensuring that the post importation isolation is carried out.
(5) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Veterinary Committee,
Model 2 of Annex IV of Directive 90/539/EEC is hereby replaced by the Annex to this Decision.
Article 3
This Decision is addressed to the Member States.
pursuant to Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the adequacy of the protection provided by the safe harbour privacy principles and related frequently asked questions issued by the US Department of Commerce
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
(1) Pursuant to Directive 95/46/EC Member States are required to provide that the transfer of personal data to a third country may take place only if the third country in question ensures an adequate level of protection and the Member State laws implementing other provisions of the Directive are respected prior to the transfer.
(4) Given the different approaches to data protection in third countries, the adequacy assessment should be carried out and any decision based on Article 25(6) of Directive 95/46/EC should be enforced in a way that does not arbitrarily or unjustifiably discriminate against or between third countries where like conditions prevail nor constitute a disguised barrier to trade taking into account the Community's present international commitments.
(7) To ensure the proper application of this Decision, it is necessary that organisations adhering to the Principles and the FAQs can be recognised by interested parties, such as data subjects, data exporters and data protection authorities. To this end the US Department of Commerce or its designee should undertake to maintain and make available to the public a list of organisations self-certifying their adherence to the Principles implemented in accordance with the FAQs and falling within the jurisdiction of at least one of the government bodies listed in Annex VII to this Decision.
(10) The Working Party on Protection of Individuals with regard to the Processing of Personal Data established under Article 29 of Directive 95/46/EC has delivered opinions on the level of protection provided by the "safe harbor" Principles in the United States which have been taken into account in the preparation of the present Decision(4).
Article 1
(b) a memorandum on damages for breaches of privacy and explicit authorisations in US law set out in Annex IV;
2. In relation to each transfer of data the following conditions shall be met:
3. The conditions set out in paragraph 2 are considered to be met for each organisation that self-certifies its adherence to the Principles implemented in accordance with the FAQs from the date on which the organisation notifies to the US Department of Commerce (or its designee) the public disclosure of the commitment referred to in paragraph 2(a) and the identity of the government body referred to in paragraph 2(b).
Article 3
(b) there is a substantial likelihood that the Principles are being violated; there is a reasonable basis for believing that the enforcement mechanism concerned is not taking or will not take adequate and timely steps to settle the case at issue; the continuing transfer would create an imminent risk of grave harm to data subjects; and the competent authorities in the Member State have made reasonable efforts under the circumstances to provide the organisation with notice and an opportunity to respond.
3. The Member States and the Commission shall also inform each other of cases where the action of bodies responsible for ensuring compliance with the Principles implemented in accordance with the FAQs in the United States fails to secure such compliance.
2. The Commission shall, if necessary, present draft measures in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 31 of Directive 95/46/EC.

(2) A dossier for the active substance RH-7281 (zoxamide) was submitted by Rohm and Haas France SA to the authorities of the United Kingdom on 2 June 1999 with a view to obtaining its inclusion in Annex I to the Directive.
(5) A dossier for the active substance AEF130360 (foramsulfuron) was submitted by Aventis GmbH to the German authorities on 30 March 2000 with a view to obtaining its inclusion in Annex I to the Directive.
(8) Article 6(3) of the Directive requires it being confirmed at the level of the Community that each dossier is to be considered as satistying in principle the data and information requirements provided for in Annex II and, for at least one plant-protection product containing the active substance concerned, in Annex III to the Directive.
(11) The Member States and the Commission agree that the United Kingdom will pursue the detailed examination for the dossier for RH-7281 (zoxamide), that the Netherlands will pursue the detailed examination for the dossier for B-41; E-187 (milbemectin) and that Germany will pursue the detailed examination for the dosssiers BAS500F (pyraclostrobin) and AEF130360 (foramsulfuron).
HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:
1. the dossier submitted by Rohm and Haas France SA to the Commission and the Member States with a view to the inclusion of RH-7281 (zoxamide) as active substance in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC and which was referred to the Standing Committee on Plant Health on 31 May 2000;
This Decision is addressed to the Members States.
on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs
Having regard to the proposal of the Commission,
Whereas:
(3) Therefore, approximation of these laws would contribute to the smooth functioning of the internal market.
(6) The prime consideration for any rules on the labelling of foodstuffs should be the need to inform and protect the consumer.
(9) Therefore, a list should be drawn up of all information which should in principle be included in the labelling of all foodstuffs.
(12) The said Community procedure must be that of a Community decision when a Member State wishes to enact new legislation.
(15) With a view to facilitating trade between Member States, it may be provided that, at stages prior to sale to the ultimate consumer, only information on the essential elements should appear on the outer packaging and certain mandatory particulars that must appear on a prepackaged foodstuff need appear only on commercial documents referring thereto.
(18) The measures necessary for the implementing of this Directive should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(5).
2. This Directive shall apply also to foodstuffs intended for supply to restaurants, hospitals, canteens and other similar mass caterers (hereinafter referred to as "mass caterers").
(b) "pre-packaged foodstuff" shall mean any single item for presentation as such to the ultimate consumer and to mass caterers, consisting of a foodstuff and the packaging into which it was put before being offered for sale, whether such packaging encloses the foodstuff completely or only partially, but in any case in such a way that the contents cannot be altered without opening or changing the packaging.
(a) be such as could mislead the purchaser to a material degree, particularly:
(iii) by suggesting that the foodstuff possesses special characteristics when in fact all similar foodstuffs possess such characteristics;
3. The prohibitions or restrictions referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall also apply to:
Article 3
(2) the list of ingredients;
(5) the date of minimum durability or, in the case of foodstuffs which, from the microbiological point of view, are highly perishable, the "use by" date;
However, the Member States shall be authorised, in respect of butter produced in their territory, to require only an indication of the manufacturer, packager or seller.
(9) instructions for use when it would be impossible to make appropriate use of the foodstuff in the absence of such instructions;
3. The provisions of this Article shall be without prejudice to more precise or more extensive provisions regarding weights and measures.
3. The Community provisions referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 20(2).
(a) In the absence of Community provisions, the name under which a product is sold shall be the name provided for in the laws, regulations and administrative provisions applicable in the Member State in which the product is sold to the final consumer or to mass caterers.
However, where the application of the other provisions of this Directive, in particular those set out in Article 3, would not enable consumers in the Member State of marketing to know the true nature of the foodstuff and to distinguish it from foodstuffs with which they could confuse it, the sales name shall be accompanied by other descriptive information which shall appear in proximity to the sales name.
3. The name under which the product is sold shall include or be accompanied by particulars as to the physical condition of the foodstuff or the specific treatment which it has undergone (e.g. powdered, freeze-dried, deep-frozen, concentrated, smoked) in all cases where omission of such information could create confusion in the mind of the purchaser.
"irradiado" or "tratado con radiación ionizante",

- fermented milk and cream,
- the trade name is identical with the ingredient name, or
4. (a) "Ingredient" shall mean any substance, including additives, used in the manufacture or preparation of a foodstuff and still present in the finished product, even if in altered form.
(i) the constituents of an ingredient which have been temporarily separated during the manufacturing process and later reintroduced but not in excess of their original proportions;
- which are used as processing aids;
5. The list of ingredients shall include all the ingredients of the foodstuff, in descending order of weight, as recorded at the time of their use in the manufacture of the foodstuff. It shall appear preceded by a suitable heading which includes the word "ingredients".
- ingredients used in concentrated or dehydrated form and reconstituted at the time of manufacture may be listed in order of weight as recorded before their concentration or dehydration,
- in the case of mixtures of spices or herbs, where none significantly predominates in proportion by weight, those ingredients may be listed in another order provided that that list of ingredients is accompanied by an expression such as "in variable proportion".
- ingredients which belong to one of the categories listed in Annex I and are constituents of another foodstuff need only be designated by the name of that category.
- ingredients belonging to one of the categories listed in Annex II must be designated by the name of that category, followed by their specific name or EC number; if an ingredient belongs to more than one of the categories, the category appropriate to the principal function in the case of the foodstuff in question shall be indicated.
- flavourings shall be designated in accordance with Annex III,
The procedure laid down in Article 19 shall apply to any such national provisions.
Such a list, however, shall not be compulsory:

(a) where the ingredient or category of ingredients concerned appears in the name under which the foodstuff is sold or is usually associated with that name by the consumer; or
(d) in the cases determined in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 20(2).
- the drained net weight of which is indicated in accordance with Article 8(4), or
- which, while appearing in the name under which the food is sold, is not such as to govern the choice of the consumer in the country of marketing because the variation in quantity is not essential to characterise the foodstuff or does not distinguish it from similar foods. In cases of doubt it shall be decided by the procedure laid down in Article 20(2) whether the conditions laid down in this indent are fulfilled;
(d) in the cases determined in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 20(2).
6. This Article shall apply without prejudice to Community rules on nutrition labelling for foodstuffs.
- in units of volume in the case of liquids,
Community provisions or, where there are none, national provisions applicable to certain specified foodstuffs may derogate from this rule.
Without prejudice to the notification provided for in Article 24, Member States shall inform the Commission and the other Member States of any measure taken pursuant to this point.
(c) Where a prepackaged item consists of two or more individual prepackaged items containing the same quantity of the same product, the net quantity shall be indicated by mentioning the net quantity contained in each individual package and the total number of such packages. Indication of these particulars shall not, however, be compulsory where the total number of individual packages can be clearly seen and easily counted from the outside and where at least one indication of the net quantity contained in each individual package can be clearly seen from the outside.
3. In the case of foodstuffs normally sold by number, Member States need not require indication of the net quantity provided that the number of items can clearly be seen and easily counted from the outside or, if not, is indicated on the labelling.
For the purposes of this paragraph, "liquid medium" shall mean the following products, possibly in mixtures and also where frozen or quick-frozen, provided that the liquid is merely an adjunct to the essential elements of that preparation and is thus not a decisive factor for the purchase: water, aqueous solutions of salts, brine, aqueous solutions of food acids, vinegar, aqueous solutions of sugars, aqueous solutions of other sweetening substances, fruit or vegetable juices in the case of fruit or vegetables.
5. It shall not be compulsory to indicate the net quantity in the case of foodstuffs:
Community provisions or, where there are none, national provisions applicable to specified foodstuffs may in exceptional cases lay down thresholds which are higher than 5 g or 5 ml provided that this does not result in the purchaser being inadequately informed.
Article 9
2. The date shall be preceded by the words:
3. The words referred to in paragraph 2 shall be accompanied by:
If need be, these particulars shall be followed by a description of the storage conditions which must be observed if the product is to keep for the specified period.

This Directive shall not affect the provisions of national laws which, in the absence of Community provisions, impose less stringent requirements for the labelling of foodstuffs presented in fancy packaging such as figurines or souvenirs.
2. Within its own territory, the Member State in which the product is marketed may, in accordance with the rules of the Treaty, stipulate that those labelling particulars shall be given in one or more languages which it shall determine from among the official languages of the Community.
Member States shall refrain from laying down requirements more detailed than those already contained in Articles 3 to 13 concerning the manner in which the particulars provided for in Article 3 and Article 4(2) are to be shown.

of 16 November 2000
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 175(1) thereof,
After consultation of the Committee of the Regions,
(1) On the basis of principles enshrined in Article 174 of the Treaty, the European Community programme of policy and action in relation to the environment and sustainable development (the Fifth Environment Action Programme)(4), supplemented by Decision No 2179/98/EC of the European Parliament and the Council(5) on its review, envisages in particular amendments to legislation on air pollutants. That programme recommends the establishment of long-term objectives on air quality. Article 174 of the Treaty requires the precautionary principle to be applied in relation to the protection of human health and the environment.
(4) Directive 96/62/EC requires that action plans be developed for zones within which concentrations of pollutants in ambient air exceed limit values, plus any temporary margins of tolerance applicable in order to ensure compliance with limit values by the dates laid down.
(7) The amendments necessary for adaptation to scientific and technical progress may relate solely to criteria and techniques for the assessment of concentrations of benzene and carbon monoxide or detailed arrangements for forwarding information to the Commission, and may not have the effect of modifying limit values either directly or indirectly.
(10) However, when limit values for benzene as set by this Directive are difficult to achieve because of site-specific dispersion characteristics or relevant climatic conditions and if the application of the measures would result in severe socio-economic problems, Member States may ask the Commission for one time-limited extension under specific conditions.
(13) Information on concentrations of benzene and carbon monoxide should be forwarded to the Commission as a basis for regular reports.
Article 1
(a) to establish limit values for concentrations of benzene and carbon monoxide in ambient air intended to avoid, prevent or reduce harmful effects on human health and the environment as a whole;
(d) to maintain ambient air quality where it is good and improve it in other cases with respect to benzene and carbon monoxide.
The definitions in Article 2 of Directive 96/62/EC shall apply.

Benzene
2. When the limit value laid down in Annex I is difficult to achieve because of site-specific dispersion characteristics or relevant climatic conditions, such as low windspeed and/or conditions conducive to evaporation, and if the application of the measures were to result in severe socio-economic problems, a Member State may ask the Commission for a time-limited extension. The Commission, acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 12(2) of Directive 96/62/EC, may, at the request of a Member State and without prejudice to Article 8(3) of this Directive, grant one extension for a period of up to five years if the Member State concerned:
- demonstrates that all reasonable measures have been taken to lower the concentrations of the pollutants concerned and to minimise the area over which the limit value is exceeded, and
Article 4
The margin of tolerance laid down in Annex II shall apply in accordance with Article 8 of Directive 96/62/EC.
1. The upper and lower assessment thresholds for benzene and carbon monoxide shall be those laid down in Section I of Annex III.
3. For zones and agglomerations within which information from fixed measurement stations is supplemented by information from other sources, such as emission inventories, indicative measurement methods and air quality modelling, the number of fixed measuring stations to be installed and the spatial resolution of other techniques shall be sufficient for the concentrations of air pollutants to be established in accordance with Section I of Annex IV, and Section I of Annex VI.
6. The date by which Member States shall inform the Commission of the methods used for the preliminary assessment of air quality under point (d) of Article 11(1) of Directive 96/62/EC shall be the date set out in Article 10 of this Directive.

Article 11
of 28 March 2000
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Whereas:
(3) Article 7 of Directive 86/362/EEC and Article 4 of Directive 90/642/EEC provide for review and adoption of any necessary measures, such as the publication by the Commission of European Community reports containing collated and compiled information of the Member States and the adoption of action to be taken at Community level in the case of reported infringements of the maximum levels. Experience has confirmed that in order that their reported results can be used with confidence, laboratories undertaking analyses of pesticide residues must operate with high levels of quality assurance. The participation of laboratories in regular proficiency tests and their implementation of common quality control procedures, may serve to fulfil the accreditation requirements of Article 3 of Council Directive 93/99/EEC of 29 October 1993 on the subject of additional measures concerning the official control of foodstuffs(4).
(6) The communication from the Commission on consumer health and food safety (COM(97) 183) describes the operation of the food; veterinary and phytosanitary control and inspection services. The monitoring of pesticide residues in and on cereals and fruit and vegetables is an activity which should be covered by the inspection service.
(9) A summary overview of the monitoring systems in all Member States is necessary to improve the monitoring of pesticide residues in the Community and to assist in its proper functioning.
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
2. In order to permit the effective year-to-year management of multiannual monitoring programmes, the Commission may submit annual confirmatory and supplementary draft recommendations; these shall be submitted to the Standing Committee on Plant Health as provided for in Article 7(2)(b) of Directive 86/362/EEC and Article 4(2)(b) of Directive 90/642/EEC.

During the visits, the Member State expert or experts appointed by the Commission shall comply with the Commission's administrative rules.
6. The provisions of this Article shall be re-examined by 31 October 2001.
This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.

(5) Article 30(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999 provides that rules on eligible expenditure should be the relevant national rules unless the Commission deems it necessary to adopt rules at Community level; for certain types of operation the Commission considers it necessary in order to guarantee the uniform and equitable implementation of the Structural Funds across the Community to adopt a common set of rules on eligible expenditure. The adoption of a rule relating to a particular type of operation does not prejudge under which of the abovementioned Funds such operation may be co-financed. The adoption of these rules should not prevent Member States, in certain cases which should be indicated, from applying stricter national provisions. The rules should apply to all expenditure incurred between the dates set out in Article 30(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999.
(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee on the Development and Conversion of Regions,

Council Framework Decision
(2001/413/JHA)
Having regard to the initiative of the Commission(1),
(1) Fraud and counterfeiting of non-cash means of payment often operate on an international scale.
(4) Since the objectives of this Framework Decision, namely to ensure that fraud and counterfeiting involving all forms of non-cash means of payment are recognised as criminal offences and are subject to effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions in all Member States cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States in view of the international dimension of those offences and can therefore be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty establishing the European Community. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Framework Decision does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.
(7) The Communication contains a Draft Joint Action which is one element of that comprehensive approach, and constitutes the starting point for this Framework Decision.
(10) By giving protection by penal law primarily to payment instruments that are provided with a special form of protection against imitation or abuse, the intention is to encourage operators to provide that protection to payment instruments issued by them, and thereby to add an element of prevention to the instrument.
Article 1
(a) "Payment instrument" shall mean a corporeal instrument, other than legal tender (bank notes and coins), enabling, by its specific nature, alone or in conjunction with another (payment) instrument, the holder or user to transfer money or monetary value, as for example credit cards, eurocheque cards, other cards issued by financial institutions, travellers' cheques, eurocheques, other cheques and bills of exchange, which is protected against imitation or fraudulent use, for example through design, coding or signature;

2. Apart from the cases provided for in paragraph 1, each Member State shall take the necessary measures to ensure that a legal person can be held liable where the lack of supervision or control by a person referred to in paragraph 1 has made possible the commission referred to in Article 2(b), (c) and (d) and Articles 3 and 4 for the benefit of that legal person by a person under its authority.
Sanctions for legal persons
(b) temporary or permanent disqualification from the practice of commercial activities;
2. Each Member State shall take the necessary measures to ensure that a legal person held liable pursuant to Article 7(2) is punishable by effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions or measures.
1. Each Member State shall take the necessary measures to establish its jurisdiction with regard to the offences referred to in Articles 2, 3, 4 and 5 where the offence has been committed:
(c) for the benefit of a legal person that has its head office in the territory of that Member State.
- paragraph 1(c).
Extradition and prosecution
2. For the purpose of this Article, a "national" of a Member State shall be construed in accordance with any declaration made by that State under Article 6(1)(b) and (c) of the European Convention on Extradition.

Article 13
Article 14
2. By 2 June 2003, Member States shall forward to the General Secretariat of the Council and to the Commission the text of the provisions transposing into their national law the obligations imposed upon them under this Framework Decision. The Council shall, by 2 September 2003, on the basis of a report established on the basis of this information and a written report by the Commission, assess the extent to which Member States have taken the necessary measures in order to comply with this Framework Decision.
This Framework Decision shall enter into force on the date of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
amending Council Directive 85/611/EEC on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS), with regard to investments of UCITS
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1),
Whereas:
(3) The definition of transferable securities included in this Directive is valid only for this Directive and in no way affects the various definitions used in national legislation for other purposes such as taxation. Consequently, shares and other securities equivalent to shares issued by bodies such as building societies and industrial and provident societies, the ownership of which cannot in practice be transferred except by the issuing body buying them back, are not covered by this definition.
(6) It is desirable to permit a UCITS to invest its assets in units of UCITS and/or other collective investment undertakings of the open-ended type which also invest in liquid financial assets mentioned in this Directive and which operate on the principle of risk spreading. It is necessary that UCITS or other collective investment undertakings in which a UCITS invests be subject to effective supervision.
(9) In addition to the case in which a UCITS invests in bank deposits according to its fund rules or instruments of incorporation, it may be necessary to allow all UCITS to hold ancillary liquid assets, such as bank deposits at sight. The holding of such ancillary liquid assets may be justified, for example, in the following cases: in order to cover current or exceptional payments; in the case of sales, for the time necessary to reinvest in transferable securities, money market instruments and/or in other financial assets provided for in this Directive; for a period of time strictly necessary when, because of unfavourable market conditions, the investment in transferable securities, money market instruments and in other financial assets must be suspended.
(12) With regard to over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives, additional requirements should be set in terms of the eligibility of counterparties and instruments, liquidity and ongoing assessment of the position. The purpose of such additional requirements is to ensure an adequate level of investor protection, close to that which they obtain when they acquire derivatives dealt in on regulated markets.
(15) Collective investment undertakings falling within the scope of this Directive should not be used for purposes other than the collective investment of the money raised from the public according to the rules laid down in this Directive. In the cases identified by this Directive a UCITS may have subsidiaries only when necessary to carry out effectively on behalf of that UCITS certain activities, also defined in this Directive. It is necessary to ensure an effective supervision of UCITS. Therefore the establishment of a subsidiary of a UCITS in a third country should be permitted only in the cases and under the conditions identified in the Directive. The general obligation to act solely in the interests of unit-holders and, in particular, the objective of increasing cost efficiencies, never justify a UCITS undertaking measures which may hinder the competent authorities from exercising effectively their supervisory functions.
(18) The Commission may consider proposing codification in due course after the adoption of the proposals,
Directive 85/611/EEC is hereby amended as follows:
- shares in companies and other securities equivalent to shares in companies ('shares'),
excluding the techniques and instruments referred to in Article 21.
4. in Article 19(1)(b) and (c), the words "and money market instruments" shall be added after the words "transferable securities";
- the following points shall be added: "(e) units of UCITS authorised according to this Directive and/or other collective investment undertakings within the meaning of the first and second indent of Article 1(2), should they be situated in a Member State or not, provided that:

In preparing its report, the Commission shall consult as widely as possible with the various industries concerned and with consumer groups and supervisory bodies.
No later than 13 August 2003 Member States shall adopt the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary for them to comply with this Directive. They shall forthwith inform the Commission thereof.
Article 4
This Directive is addressed to the Member States.
on the application of Articles 87 and 88 of the EC Treaty to State aid to small and medium-sized enterprises
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 994/98 of 7 May 1998 on the application of Articles 92 and 93 of the Treaty establishing the European Community to certain categories of horizontal State aid(1), and in particular points (a)(i) and (b) of Article 1(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(3) The Commission has applied Articles 87 and 88 of the Treaty to small and medium-sized enterprises in and outside assisted areas in numerous decisions and has also stated its policy, most recently in the Community guidelines on State aid for small and medium-sized enterprises(3) and in the guidelines on national regional aid(4). In the light of the Commission's considerable experience in applying those Articles to small and medium-sized enterprises and in the light of the general texts relating to small and medium-sized enterprises and to regional aid issued by the Commission on the basis of those provisions, it is appropriate, with a view to ensuring efficient supervision and simplifying administration without weakening Commission monitoring, that the Commission should make use of the powers conferred by Regulation (EC) No 994/98.
(6) This Regulation should exempt any aid that meets all the relevant requirements of this Regulation, and any aid scheme, provided that any aid that could be granted under such scheme meets all the relevant requirements of this Regulation. With a view to ensuring efficient supervision and simplifying administration without weakening Commission monitoring, aid schemes and individual grants outside any aid scheme should contain an express reference to this Regulation.
(9) In accordance with the established practice of the Commission, and with a view to better ensuring that aid is proportionate and limited to the amount necessary, thresholds should be expressed in terms of aid intensities in relation to a set of eligible costs, rather than in terms of maximum aid amounts.
(12) The ceilings of aid intensity should be fixed, in the light of the Commission's experience, at a level that strikes the appropriate balance between minimising distortions of competition in the aided sector and the objective of facilitating the development of the economic activities of small and medium-sized enterprises.
(15) In order not to favour the capital factor of an investment over the labour factor, provision should be made for the possibility of measuring aid to investment on the basis of either the costs of the investment or the costs of new employment linked to the carrying-out of the investment project.
(18) In order to ensure that the aid is necessary and acts as an incentive to develop certain activities, this Regulation should not exempt aid for activities in which the beneficiary would already engage under market conditions alone.
(21) Having regard to the Commission's experience in this area, and in particular the frequency with which it is generally necessary to revise State aid policy, it is appropriate to limit the period of application of this Regulation. Should this Regulation expire without being extended, aid schemes already exempted by this Regulation should continue to be exempted for six months,
Scope
(a) to activities linked to the production, processing or marketing of products listed in Annex I to the Treaty;
Article 2
(a) "aid" shall mean any measure fulfilling all the criteria laid down in Article 87(1) of the Treaty;
(d) "investment in intangible assets" shall mean investment in transfer of technology by the acquisition of patent rights, licences, know-how or unpatented technical knowledge;
(g) "number of employees" shall mean the number of annual labour units (ALU), namely the number of persons employed full time in one year, part-time and seasonal work being ALU fractions.
1. Individual aid outside any scheme, fulfilling all the conditions of this Regulation, shall be compatible with the common market within the meaning of Article 87(3) of the Treaty and shall be exempt from the notification requirement of Article 88(3) of the Treaty provided that it contains an express reference to this Regulation, by citing its title and publication reference in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
(b) the scheme contains an express reference to this Regulation, by citing its title and publication reference in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
Investment
(a) 15 % in the case of small enterprises;
(a) 10 percentage points gross in areas covered by Article 87(3)(c), provided that the total net aid intensity does not exceed 30 %; or
4. The ceilings fixed in paragraphs 2 and 3 shall apply to intensity of the aid calculated either as a percentage of the investment's eligible costs or as a percentage of the wage costs of employment created by the carrying-out of an investment (aid to job creation) or a combination thereof, provided the aid does not exceed the most favourable amount resulting from the application of either calculation.
(a) job creation shall be linked to the carrying-out of a project of investment in tangible or intangible assets. Jobs shall be created within three years of the investment's completion;
Article 5
(a) for services provided by outside consultants, the gross aid shall not exceed 50 % of the costs of such services. The services concerned shall not be a continuous or periodic activity nor relate to the enterprise's usual operating expenditure, such as routine tax consultancy services, regular legal services, or advertising;
Large individual aid grants
(i) in areas which do not qualify for regional aid, the gross aid intensity is at least 50 % of the ceilings laid down in Article 4(2);
Article 7
- either an application for aid has been submitted to the Member State by the beneficiary, or
Cumulation
Article 9
2. Member States shall maintain detailed records regarding the aid schemes exempted by this Regulation, the individual aid granted under those schemes, and the individual aid exempted by this Regulation that is granted outside any existing aid scheme. Such records shall contain all information necessary to establish that the conditions for exemption, as laid down in this Regulation, are fulfilled, including information on the status of the company as an SME. Member States shall keep a record regarding an individual aid for 10 years from the date on which it was granted, and regarding an aid scheme, for 10 years from the date on which the last individual aid was granted under such scheme. On written request, the Member State concerned shall provide the Commission, within a period of 20 working days or such longer period as may be fixed in the request, with all the information which the Commission considers necessary to assess whether the conditions of this Regulation have been complied with.
Entry into force and period of validity
of 9 February 2001
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 2734/2000 of 14 December 2000 amending Regulation (EEC) No 1627/89 on the buying-in of beef by invitation to tender and derogating from or amending Regulation (EC) No 562/2000 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 as regards the buying-in of beef(2), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 3/2001(3), introduces a number of amendments to or derogations from Commission Regulation (EC) No 562/2000(4) to address the exceptional situation on the market resulting from recent events relating to bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE).
(4) Since products bought in can also be sold after 1 January 2002, when the system of compulsory labelling based on origin laid down by Regulation (EC) No 1760/2000 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 July 2000 establishing a system for the identification and registration of bovine animals and regarding the labelling of beef and beef products and repealing Regulation (EC) No 820/97(5) will apply, the labels of products intended for intervention pursuant to contracts concluded on or after 12 February 2001 (i.e. with effect from the first invitation to tender in the month of February) should be required to include an indication of the country or countries of birth and fattening of the animals concerned, in accordance with Article 13(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1760/2000, together with the indications laid down in Article 2(2) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1825/2000(6) laying down detailed rules for the application of Regulation (EC) No 1760/2000, as appropriate.
(7) In view of the way the situation is developing, this Regulation should enter into force immediately.
Article 1
- no maximum carcase limit shall apply to the two invitations to tender in February 2001,
Regulation (EC) No 562/2000 is amended as follows:
2. Point 2(b) of Annex III is replaced by the following:
This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
amending Annex II to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 laying down a Community procedure for the establishment of maximum residue limits of veterinary medicinal products in foodstuffs of animal origin
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
(1) In accordance with Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90, maximum residue limits must be established progressively for all pharmacologically active substances which are used within the Community in veterinary medicinal products intended for administration to food-producing animals.
(4) For the control of residues, as provided for in appropriate Community legislation, maximum residue limits should usually be established for the target tissues of liver or kidney. However, the liver and kidney are frequently removed from carcases moving in international trade, and maximum residue limits should therefore also always be established for muscle or fat tissues.
(7) An adequate period should be allowed before the entry into force of this Regulation in order to allow Member States to make any adjustment which may be necessary to the authorisations to place the veterinary medicinal products concerned on the market which have been granted in accordance with Council Directive 81/851/EEC(3), as last amended by Commission Directive 2000/37/EC(4), to take account of the provisions of this Regulation.
Article 1
This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 104/2000 as regards the grant of flat-rate aid for certain fishery products
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 104/2000 of 17 December 1999 on the common organisation of the markets in fishery and aquaculture products(1), and in particular Article 24(8) thereof,
(2) In the interests of harmonisation and simplification, the procedures required in the context of flat-rate aid should be the same as those which apply to financial compensation and carry-over aid, as set out in Commission Regulation (EC) No 2509/2000 of 15 November 2000 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 104/2000 as regards granting financial compensation for withdrawals of certain fishery products(3) and Commission Regulation (EC) No 2814/2000 of 21 December 2000 laying down the detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 104/2000 as regards the grant of carry-over aid for certain fishery products(4). The conditions for granting flat-rate aid should therefore be established on that basis and Commission Regulation (EEC) No 4176/88 of 28 December 1988 laying down detailed rules of application for the granting of flat-rate aid for certain fisheries products(5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 3516/93(6), should be repealed.
(5) The flat-rate aid may be paid only at the end of the fishing year. However, provision should be made for the possibility of granting advances subject to the lodging of a security.
(8) The recipients of aid should keep a stock record containing the figures for releases onto the market, withdrawals from the market and amounts carried over each month (in kilograms) to increase the efficiency of checks and should supply this information to the Member State. It is sufficient for the purposes of good management of the mechanism to require stock records during the minimum storage periods.
CHAPTER I
Article 2
Conditions for granting the flat-rate aid referred to in Article 24(2) of Regulation (EC) No 104/2000 (hereinafter referred to as "flat-rate compensation")
Article 4
CHAPTER III
1. The amount of the flat-rate premium shall be fixed before the beginning of each fishing year in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 38(2) of Regulation (EC) No 104/2000. The amount shall be fixed per unit weight, to be applied to the net weight of each product listed in Annex IV to that Regulation.
(a) energy costs;
(d) processing costs (ingredients);
5. The level of the flat-rate premium fixed for the fishing year concerned shall apply to products entering storage during that year, irrespective of the end of the storage period.
Article 7
Final provisions
2. Advance payments shall be granted each month at the request of the producer organisation concerned for the quantities withdrawn or carried over, on condition that it lodges a security of at least 105 % of the amount advanced.
Article 9
3. Producer organisations shall communicate the date, species and quantity of products withdrawn or carried over to the Member State each month.
Article 11
Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee(2),
Whereas:
(3) This Regulation directly concerns public health and is relevant to the functioning of the internal market. It covers products which are included in Annex I to the Treaty as well as products which are not. Consequently, it is appropriate to choose Article 152(4)(b) of the Treaty as the legal basis.
(6) Provision should be made for safeguard measures to be taken by the Commission in cases where a risk from a TSE has not been adequately addressed by the competent authority of a Member State or third country.
(9) Member States should carry out an annual programme for monitoring BSE and scrapie and should inform the Commission and the other Member States of the results and of the emergence of any other TSE.
(12) The suspected presence of any TSE in any animal should be notified to the competent authority, which should immediately take all appropriate measures, including placing the suspect animal under movement restrictions while awaiting the results of the investigation or having it slaughtered under official supervision. If the competent authority cannot exclude the possibility of a TSE, it should have the appropriate investigations carried out and should keep the carcasse under official supervision until a diagnosis has been made.
(15) Provisions should be laid down covering the placing on the market of certain live animals and products of animal origin. Existing Community rules on the identification and registration of bovine animals provide for a system enabling the animals to be traced back to the dam and herd of origin in accordance with international standards. Equivalent guarantees should be provided for bovine animals imported from third countries. The animals and products of animal origin covered by Community rules, moving in intra-Community trade or imported from third countries, should be accompanied by the certificates required by the said rules, supplemented as appropriate in accordance with this Regulation.
(18) Community inspections should be carried out in the Member States in order to ensure uniform implementation of the requirements concerning the prevention, control and eradication of TSEs and provision should also be made for the implementation of audit procedures. In order to ensure that guarantees equivalent to those applied by the Community are provided by third countries upon import into the Community of live animals and products of animal origin, Community on-the-spot inspections and audits should be carried out in order to verify that the import conditions are met by exporting third countries.
(21) The necessary transitional measures in particular for regulating the use of specified risk material should be provided for in the framework of this Regulation.
(24) Given that the provisions for the implementation of this Regulation are general measures within the meaning of Article 2 of Decision 1999/468/EC, they should be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure laid down in Article 5 of that Decision,
GENERAL PROVISIONS
1. This Regulation lays down rules for the prevention, control and eradication of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) in animals. It shall apply to the production and placing on the market of live animals and products of animal origin and in certain specific cases to exports thereof.
(b) products which are not intended for use in human food, animal feed or fertilisers, or to their starting materials or intermediate products;
Article 2
Rules for the implementation of this Article shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 24(2).
1. For the purposes of this Regulation the following definitions shall apply:
(c) products of animal origin: any product derived from or containing a product derived from any animal covered by the provisions of Directive 89/662/EEC(5) or Directive 90/425/EEC(6);
(f) category: one of the classification categories referred to in Chapter C of Annex II;
(i) holding: any place in which animals covered by this Regulation are held, kept, bred, handled or shown to the public;
(l) rapid tests: the analysis methods referred to in Annex X, Chapter C, point 4, and for which the results are known within 24 hours;
3. Where the terms in this Regulation are not defined in paragraph 1 or Annex I, the relevant definitions given in Regulation (EC) No 1760/2000(7) and those given in or pursuant to Directives 64/432/EEC(8), 89/662/EEC, 90/425/EEC and 91/68/EEC(9) shall apply insofar as reference is made to them in this text.
1. With regard to the implementation of safeguard measures, the principles and provisions set out in Article 9 of Directive 89/662/EEC, Article 10 of Directive 90/425/EEC, Article 18 of Directive 91/496/EEC(10) and Article 22 of Directive 97/78/EC(11) shall apply.
DETERMINATION OF BSE STATUS
1. The BSE status of a Member State, of a third country, or of one of their regions (hereinafter referred to as "countries or regions") may be determined only on the basis of the criteria set out in Annex II, Chapter A, and the outcome of a risk analysis on the basis of all the potential factors for the appearance of bovine spongiform encephalopathy as defined in Annex II, Chapter B, and their development over time.
This decision shall be taken within six months of the submission of the application and of the relevant information referred to in the second subparagraph of paragraph 1. If the Commission finds that the supporting evidence does not include the information laid down in Annex II, Chapters A and B, it shall ask for additional information to be provided within a period to be specified. The final decision shall then be taken within six months of the submission of all information.
Such a risk analysis must include a conclusive statistical survey of the epidemiological situation regarding TSEs in the applicant Member State or third country, on the basis of the use, in a screening procedure, of rapid tests. The Commission shall take into account the classification criteria used by the OIE.
The cost of such screening procedure shall be borne by the Member State or third country concerned.
6. The retention of a third country on one of the lists provided for by Community rules for the purpose of being allowed to export to the Community live animals and products of animal origin for which this Regulation provides specific rules shall be decided upon under the procedure laid down in Article 24(2) and shall be made conditional - in the light of the information available or where a TSE is presumed to be present - on the information provided for in paragraph 1 being supplied. In the event of refusal to supply the said information within three months of the date of the Commission's request, the provisions of paragraph 4 of this Article shall apply until this information has been submitted and evaluated in accordance with paragraphs 2 or 3.
8. The decisions referred to in paragraphs 2, 3, 4, 6 and 7 shall be based on a risk assessment, taking into consideration the recommended criteria set out in Annex II, Chapters A and B.
Article 6
Rapid tests shall be approved for that purpose in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 24(2) and listed in Annex X, Chapter C, point 4.
4. Member States shall submit an annual report to the Commission covering at least the information referred to in Annex III, Chapter B, Part I. The report for each calendar year shall be submitted at the latest by 31 March of the following year. The Commission shall present a summary of the national reports covering at least the information referred to in Annex III, Chapter B, Part II, to the Standing Veterinary Committee within three months of the receipt of the said reports.
1. The feeding to ruminants of protein derived from mammals is prohibited.
4. Member States, or regions thereof, in category 5 shall not be permitted to export or store feed intended for farmed animals which contains protein derived from mammals or feed intended for mammals, except for dogs and cats, which contains processed protein derived from mammals.
Article 8
That specified risk material or the material processed therefrom may be placed on the market or, if need be, exported only for final destruction in accordance with points 3 and 4 or as appropriate 7(c) or 8 of Annex V. It may not be imported into the Community. Transit of specified risk material through Community territory must take place in accordance with the requirements of Article 3 of Directive 91/496/EEC.
3. In Member States, or regions thereof, which are placed in categories 2, 3, 4 and 5 referred to in Annex II, Chapter C, the laceration, after stunning, of central nervous tissue by means of an elongated rod-shaped instrument introduced into the cranial cavity shall not be used on bovine, ovine or caprine animals whose meat is destined for human or animal consumption.
Similarly, by way of derogation from paragraphs 1 to 4, after consultation of the appropriate scientific committee and on the basis of an assessment of the incident, propagation and human exposure risk, a decision may be adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 24(2) to allow the use for food, feed and fertilisers of vertebral column and dorsal root ganglia from bovine animals in or coming from each country or region thereof placed in category 5.
Products of animal origin derived from or containing ruminant material
3. Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply, in the light of the criteria set out in point 5 of Annex V, to ruminants which have undergone an alternative test which has been recognised in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 24(2), where the results of the test were negative.

CHAPTER IV
Notification
The competent authority shall without delay take the measures laid down in Article 12 of this Regulation, together with any other necessary measures.
1. Any animal suspected of being infected by a TSE shall be placed under an official movement restriction until the results of a clinical and epidemiological examination carried out by the competent authority are known, or killed for laboratory examination under official control.
If there is evidence that the holding where the animal was present when BSE was suspected is not likely to be the holding where the animal could have been exposed to BSE, the competent authority may decide that only the animal suspected of being infected shall be placed under an official movement restriction. If considered necessary, the competent authority may also decide that other holdings or only the holding of exposure shall be placed under official control depending on the epidemiological information available.
3. All parts of the body of the suspect animal including the hide shall be retained under official control until a negative diagnosis has been made or shall be destroyed in accordance with Annex V, point 3 or 4.
Measures following confirmation of the presence of a TSE
(b) an inquiry shall be carried out to identify all animals at risk in accordance with Annex VII, point 1;
2. Pending the implementation of the measures referred to in paragraph 1(b) and (c), the holding on which the animal was present when the presence of a TSE was confirmed shall be placed under official control and all movement of animals susceptible to TSEs and products of animal origin derived from them from or to the holding shall be subject to authorisation by the competent authority, with a view to ensuring immediate tracing and identification of the animals and products of animal origin concerned.
4. Owners shall be compensated without delay for the loss of the animals that have been killed or products of animal origin destroyed in accordance with Article 12(2) and paragraph 1(a) and (c) of this Article.
Article 14
2. Where necessary to enable Community legislation to be applied uniformly, the guidelines may be harmonised in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 24(2).
Article 15
2. The placing on the market of first generation progeny, semen, embryos and ova of TSE suspect or confirmed animals shall be subject to the conditions laid down in Annex VIII, Chapter B.
Placing on the market of products of animal origin
(b) (i) raw milk within the meaning of Directive 92/46/EEC(13);
(iv) di-calcium phosphate (without any trace of protein or fat);
(vii) collagen derived from the hides and skins referred to in point (v).
(a) animals born after the date from which the prohibition on the feeding to ruminants of animal protein derived from mammals was effectively enforced; or
4. When an animal is moved from a country or a region to country or region included in another category, it shall be classified in the highest category of the countries or regions in which it has stayed over twenty-four hours unless adequate guarantees can be provided certifying that the animal has not received feedingstuffs from the country or region classified in the highest category.
7. In accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 24(2), the provisions of paragraphs 1 to 6 may be extended to other products of animal origin. Rules for the implementation of this Article shall be adopted by the same procedure.
Appropriate commercial documents relating to trade in products of animal origin shall be supplemented, where necessary, by a reference to the category of the Member State or region of origin given by the Commission in accordance with Article 5.
CHAPTER VI

Article 25
Article 26
Commission Regulation (EC) No 1282/2001
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Whereas:
(3) In order to facilitate market management operations, a time limit should be laid down for making declarations. Since harvesting takes place at different times in different Member States, the deadlines for declarations by producers should be staggered. Provision should also be made to require operators selling wine products before the dates specified for declarations to make declarations.
(6) The category of "other wines" should be defined in keeping with the classification of vine varieties that may be cultivated in the Community, as established by the Member States in accordance with Article 19 of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999.
(9) Harvest and stock declarations submitted by the various parties concerned are currently the only means of properly knowing the quantities of wine produced and wine stocks. Appropriate steps therefore need to be taken to ensure that declarations are presented by the parties concerned and are complete and accurate by providing for penalties where declarations are not forthcoming or are false or incomplete when presented. To facilitate the processing of data relating to declarations, each declaration presented in a competent administrative unit should be considered separately from any others that the same producer may have presented in other administrative units in the Member State.
(12) In this connection it should be recalled that, to ensure effective monitoring of the market and to allow reliable budget forecasts to be made in good time, the dates laid down for sending information must be complied with.

(4) Article 4(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 3880/91 provides that Member States, with the prior approval of Eurostat, may submit data in a different form or on a different medium from that laid down in Annex IV to the Regulation.
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 2
This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
amending Regulation (EC) No 1623/2000 laying down detailed rules for implementing Council Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 on the common organisation of the market in wine with regard to market mechanisms
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in wine(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2826/2000(2), and in particular Articles 33 and 36 thereof,
(2) Article 63 of Regulation (EC) No 1623/2000 provides for the introduction of an aid scheme for the distillation of potable alcohol from wine. That scheme was first introduced for the 2000/01 wine year. Changes are required in line with experience gained in the first year of application. In particular, distillation should be opened later in the year and the percentage of production that wine producers can deliver for distillation should be smaller. In addition, a time limit must be set for distillation.
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
1. The first paragraph of Article 58 is replaced by the following: "Producers subject to one of the obligations referred to in Articles 45 or 52 of this Regulation and who have delivered at least 90 % of the quantity of product which they are obliged to deliver before 15 July of the current wine year may discharge their obligation by delivering the remaining quantity before a date, to be fixed by the competent national authority, which may not be after 31 July of the following wine year."
2. The quantity of table wine and wine suitable for yielding table wine that each producer may have distilled shall not exceed 30 % of his highest production of such wine declared in the last three wine years, including the current year if production has already been declared. Where the above percentage is applied, the quantity of table wine produced shall be that given as wine in the column headed 'Table wines' of the declaration of quantities produced as referred to in Article 18(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999."
4. Article 91(12) is replaced by the following: "12. The intervention agency concerned shall release the export security for each quantity of alcohol for which it receives proof of export within the time limit allowed. Notwithstanding Article 23 of Regulation (EEC) No 2220/85 and except in cases of force majeure, where the time limit for export is exceeded the following percentages of the export security of EUR 3 per hectolitre of alcohol at 100 % vol shall be forfeit:
5. The second and third subparagraphs of Article 95(2) are replaced by the following: "This prohibition shall not relate to alcohol in vats not covered by the notices of invitation to tender or public sale concerned or not specified in the Commission decision referred to in Articles 83 to 93.
(a) Paragraph 1 is replaced by the following: "1. From the publication of a notice of invitation to tender to the closing date for the submission of tenders in response to that invitation, interested parties may obtain samples of the alcohol put up for sale against payment of EUR 10 per litre. The quantity made available to individual interested parties may not exceed five litres per vat. For disposal under subsection III, samples may be obtained for the same consideration in the 30 days following the notice of public sale."
(b) tenderers offered replacement alcohol pursuant to Article 83(3) may obtain samples of the replacement alcohol proposed.
Article 2
of 22 August 2001
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,

For the efficient management of the domestic market in skimmed-milk powder - a product that may be subject to intervention measures - export licences for that product should be made compulsory and provision should be made for the notification of this information by the Member States to the Commission. Commission Regulation (EC) No 1498/1999 of 8 July 1999 laying down rules for the application of Council Regulation (EEC) No 804/68 as regards communications between Member States and the Commission in the milk and milk products sector(5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 732/2001(6), should therefore be amended.
(4) The full licences for exports without a refund to the United States under the supplementary quota arising from the Agreement on Agriculture included in the Uruguay Round GATT Agreements(7) (hereinafter referred to as the "Agreement on Agriculture") do not require a security to be lodged. In order to best ensure that this quota is actually filled and that the licences issued to this end are really used, provision should be made for the lodgement of a security.
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
1. The following second subparagraph is added to Article 1(1): "However, the first subparagraph notwithstanding, an export licence must be presented for all exports of the products referred to in Annex I, Number II."
4. In the second subparagraph of Article 20(2), "EUR 9" is replaced by "EUR 6".
The security for the full licence shall be released only on presentation of the proof referred to in Article 35(5) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000(8)."
(a) the quantities, broken down by code of the export refund nomenclature for milk products and by destination code, covered by applications submitted that day for licences:
(c) the quantities, broken down by code of the export refund nomenclature for milk products and by destination code, for which the provisional licences referred to in Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 174/1999 were definitively issued or cancelled that day, indicating the body issuing the invitation to tender, the date of the provisional licence and the quantity it covers.
This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
amending Regulation (EC) No 723/97 on the implementation of Member States' action programmes on control of EAGGF Guarantee Section expenditure
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1),
(1) Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 723/97(3) provides for the Community to contribute towards costs incurred by Member States in implementing new action programmes, arising out of new Community obligations, approved by the Commission and aimed at improving the structures or effectiveness of EAGGF Guarantee Section expenditure controls. Article 4 of the said Regulation provides that the Community financial contribution is to be granted per calendar year for a period of five consecutive years starting from 1997, within the limit of the annual appropriations authorised by the budget authority in the light of the financial perspective.
(4) The period during which Community financial contribution may be paid should therefore be extended by two years.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Whereas:
(3) No statements of objection within the meaning of Article 7 of Regulation (EEC) No 2081/92 have been forwarded to the Commission following publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities(3) of the names in the Annex to this Regulation.
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 2
of 4 February 2002
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Whereas:
(3) Commission Regulation (EC) No 194/97 of 31 January 1997 setting maximum levels for certain contaminants in foodstuffs(2), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1566/1999(3), sets maximum levels for certain contaminants and in particular aflatoxins in foodstuffs. These limits have been considerably exceeded in samples of peanuts originating in or consigned from China.
(6) It is necessary that peanuts and products derived from peanuts have been produced, sorted, handled, processed, packaged and transported following good hygiene practices. It is necessary to establish the levels of aflatoxin B1 and total aflatoxin in samples taken from the consignment immediately prior to leaving China.
(9) It is therefore necessary in order to safeguard public health that all lots of peanuts originating in or consigned from China, imported in the European Community, are subjected to sampling and analysis for their aflatoxin level by the competent authority of the importing Member State prior to release onto the market. Given that this measure has a serious impact on the control resources of the Member States, the results of this measure will be evaluated after a short period of time and the measures amended if appropriate.
Article 1
- peanuts falling within CN code 2008 11 94 (in immediate packs of a net content exceeding 1 kg) or 2008 11 98 (in immediate packs of a net content not exceeding 1 kg),
3. Each consignment shall be identified with a code, which corresponds to the code on the health certificate and on the accompanying report containing the result of the official sampling and analysis referred to in paragraph 1.
Article 2
amending Decision 94/262/ECSC, EC, Euratom on the regulations and general conditions governing the performance of the Ombudsman's duties
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community and in particular Article 195(2) thereof,
Having regard to the European Parliament resolution of 17 November 2000 on the modification of the European Parliament's decision of 9 March 1994 on the regulations and general conditions governing the performance of the Ombudsman's duties(1),
Whereas:
(3) It is therefore necessary to amend European Parliament Decision 94/262/ECSC, EC, Euratom of 9 March 1994 on the regulations and general conditions governing the performance of the Ombudsman's duties(3) since it provides for the budget of the Ombudsman to be placed in an annex to Section I (Parliament) of the general budget of the European Communities.
Article 1
Commission Decision
(Text with EEA relevance)
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
(2) National regulatory authorities have been set up in all Member States to carry out the regulatory tasks specified in these Directives and as to be notified to the Commission in accordance with Article 3(6) of the Framework Directive. In accordance with the Framework Directive, Member States must guarantee the independence of national regulatory authorities by ensuring that they are legally distinct from and functionally independent of all organisations providing electronic communications networks, equipment or services. Member States that retain ownership or control of undertakings providing electronic communications networks and/or services must also ensure effective structural separation of the regulatory function from activities associated with ownership or control.
(5) A European Regulators Group for Electronic Communications Networks and Services (hereinafter referred to as the Group) should be established to provide an interface for advising and assisting the Commission in the electronic communications field.
(8) Close cooperation should be maintained between the Group and the Communications Committee established under the Framework Directive. The work of the Group should not interfere with the work of the Committee.
Article 1
Article 2
Article 3
The Group shall provide an interface between national regulatory authorities and the Commission in such a way as to contribute to the development of the internal market and to the consistent application in all Member States of the regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services.
The Group shall be composed of the heads of each relevant national regulatory authority in each Member State or their representatives.
Operational arrangements
The chairperson shall convene the meetings of the Group in agreement with the Commission.
Experts from EEA States and those states that are candidates for accession to the European Union may participate as observers in the Group. The Group may invite other experts and observers to attend its meetings
The Group shall consult extensively and at an early stage with market participants, consumers and end-users in an open and transparent manner.
Without prejudice to the provisions of Article 287 of the Treaty, where the Commission informs them that the advice requested or the question raised is of a confidential nature, members of the Group as well as observers and any other person shall be under an obligation not to disclose information which has come to their knowledge through the work of the Group, its subgroups or expert groups. The Commission may decide in such cases that only members of the Group may be present at meetings.
The Group shall submit an annual report of its activities to the Commission. The Commission shall transmit the report to the European Parliament and to the Council, where appropriate with comments.
This Decision shall enter into force the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
amending Decision 94/652/EC as regards updating the inventory of tasks to be undertaken within the framework of cooperation by Member States in the scientific examination of questions relating to food
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
(1) Commission Decision 94/458/EC of 29 June 1994(2) lays down rules on the administrative management of cooperation in the scientific examination of questions relating to food.
(4) The tasks should be distributed having regard to the scientific expertise and resources available within the Member States, and in particular the institutes which will be participating in the scientific cooperation.
HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:
Article 2
of 11 March 2002
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 137(2) thereof,
Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions(3),
(1) Pursuant to Article 136 of the Treaty, a particular objective of the Community and the Member States is to promote social dialogue between management and labour.
(4) Following this consultation, the Commission considered that Community action was advisable and again consulted management and labour on the contents of the planned proposal; management and labour have presented their opinions to the Commission.
(7) There is a need to strengthen dialogue and promote mutual trust within undertakings in order to improve risk anticipation, make work organisation more flexible and facilitate employee access to training within the undertaking while maintaining security, make employees aware of adaptation needs, increase employees' availability to undertake measures and activities to increase their employability, promote employee involvement in the operation and future of the undertaking and increase its competitiveness.
(10) The Community has drawn up and implemented an employment strategy based on the concepts of "anticipation", "prevention" and "employability", which are to be incorporated as key elements into all public policies likely to benefit employment, including the policies of individual undertakings, by strengthening the social dialogue with a view to promoting change compatible with preserving the priority objective of employment.
(13) The existing legal frameworks for employee information and consultation at Community and national level tend to adopt an excessively a posteriori approach to the process of change, neglect the economic aspects of decisions taken and do not contribute either to genuine anticipation of employment developments within the undertaking or to risk prevention.
(16) This Directive is without prejudice to those systems which provide for the direct involvement of employees, as long as they are always free to exercise the right to be informed and consulted through their representatives.
(19) The purpose of this general framework is also to avoid any administrative, financial or legal constraints which would hinder the creation and development of small and medium-sized undertakings. To this end, the scope of this Directive should be restricted, according to the choice made by Member States, to undertakings with at least 50 employees or establishments employing at least 20 employees.
(22) A Community framework for informing and consulting employees should keep to a minimum the burden on undertakings or establishments while ensuring the effective exercise of the rights granted.
(25) Undertakings and establishments should be protected against disclosure of certain particularly sensitive information.
(28) Administrative or judicial procedures, as well as sanctions that are effective, dissuasive and proportionate in relation to the seriousness of the offence, should be applicable in cases of infringement of the obligations based on this Directive.
(31) Implementation of this Directive should not be sufficient grounds for a reduction in the general level of protection of workers in the areas to which it applies,
Object and principles
3. When defining or implementing practical arrangements for information and consultation, the employer and the employees' representatives shall work in a spirit of cooperation and with due regard for their reciprocal rights and obligations, taking into account the interests both of the undertaking or establishment and of the employees.
For the purposes of this Directive:
(c) "employer" means the natural or legal person party to employment contracts or employment relationships with employees, in accordance with national law and practice;
(f) "information" means transmission by the employer to the employees' representatives of data in order to enable them to acquaint themselves with the subject matter and to examine it;
Scope
(b) establishments employing at least 20 employees in any one Member State.
3. Member States may derogate from this Directive through particular provisions applicable to the crews of vessels plying the high seas.
1. In accordance with the principles set out in Article 1 and without prejudice to any provisions and/or practices in force more favourable to employees, the Member States shall determine the practical arrangements for exercising the right to information and consultation at the appropriate level in accordance with this Article.
(b) information and consultation on the situation, structure and probable development of employment within the undertaking or establishment and on any anticipatory measures envisaged, in particular where there is a threat to employment;
4. Consultation shall take place:
(c) on the basis of information supplied by the employer in accordance with Article 2(f) and of the opinion which the employees' representatives are entitled to formulate;
Article 5
Article 6
2. Member States shall provide, in specific cases and within the conditions and limits laid down by national legislation, that the employer is not obliged to communicate information or undertake consultation when the nature of that information or consultation is such that, according to objective criteria, it would seriously harm the functioning of the undertaking or establishment or would be prejudicial to it.
Protection of employees' representatives

Article 14
Directive 2002/61/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee(2),
(1) Work on the internal market should gradually improve the quality of life, health protection and consumer safety. The measures provided for in this Directive ensure a high level of health and consumer protection.
(4) The Scientific Committee on Toxicity, Ecotoxicity and the Environment (CSTEE), after being consulted by the Commission, has confirmed that cancer risks posed by textile and leather goods coloured by certain azodyes, give cause for concern.
(7) Harmonised testing methods are necessary for the application of this Directive. The Commission, in accordance with Article 2a of Directive 76/769/EEC, should establish such methods. The testing methods should preferably be developed at European level, if appropriate by the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN).
(10) This Directive applies without prejudice to Community legislation laying down minimum requirements for the protection of workers contained in Council Directive 89/391/EEC(5) and in individual directives based thereon, in particular Council Directive 90/394/EEC(6) and Directive 98/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council(7),
Annex I to Directive 76/769/EEC is hereby amended as set out in the Annex to this Directive.

Whereas:
(3) Council Directive 92/6/EEC(4) provides that, depending on technical possibilities and experiences in Member States, the requirements on installation and use of speed limitation devices could subsequently be extended to light goods vehicles.
(6) Since the objectives of the proposed action, namely the introduction of modifications to the Community-wide arrangements for the installation and use of speed limitation devices on certain heavy vehicle categories, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale or effects of the action, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve those objectives.

Article 4
of 16 December 2002
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 47(2) thereof,
After consulting the Committee of the Regions,
Whereas:
(3) The Commission Action Plan for Financial Services identifies a series of actions which are needed to complete the Single Market in Financial Services, and announces the development of supplementary prudential legislation for financial conglomerates which will address loopholes in the present sectoral legislation and additional prudential risks to ensure sound supervisory arrangements with regard to financial groups with cross-sectoral financial activities. Such an ambitious objective can only be attained in stages. The establishment of the supplementary supervision of credit institutions, insurance undertakings and investment firms in a financial conglomerate is one such stage.
(6) Decisions not to include a particular entity in the scope of supplementary supervision should be taken, bearing in mind inter alia whether or not such entity is included in the group-wide supervision under sectoral rules.
(9) All financial conglomerates subject to supplementary supervision should have a coordinator appointed from among the competent authorities involved.
(12) There is a pressing need for increased collaboration between authorities responsible for the supervision of credit institutions, insurance undertakings and investment firms, including the development of ad hoc cooperation arrangements between the authorities involved in the supervision of entities belonging to the same financial conglomerate.
(15) This Directive does not require the disclosure by competent authorities to a financial conglomerates committee of information which is subject to an obligation of confidentiality under this Directive or other sectoral directives.
(18) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Directive should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(5).
(21) In order to assess the need for and prepare any possible future harmonisation of the treatment of asset management companies under sectoral rules, the Commission should report on Member States' practices in this field,
OBJECTIVE AND DEFINITIONS
This Directive lays down rules for supplementary supervision of regulated entities which have obtained an authorisation pursuant to Article 6 of Directive 73/239/EEC, Article 6 of Directive 79/267/EEC, Article 3(1) of Directive 93/22/EEC or Article 4 of Directive 2000/12/EC, and which are part of a financial conglomerate.

Article 3
2. For the purposes of determining whether activities in different financial sectors are significant within the meaning of Article 2(14)(e), for each financial sector the average of the ratio of the balance sheet total of that financial sector to the balance sheet total of the financial sector entities in the group and the ratio of the solvency requirements of the same financial sector to the total solvency requirements of the financial sector entities in the group should exceed 10 %.
(a) the relative size of its smallest financial sector does not exceed 5 %, measured either in terms of the average referred to in paragraph 2 or in terms of the balance sheet total or the solvency requirements of such financial sector; or

Where a financial conglomerate has been identified according to paragraphs 1, 2 and 3, the decisions referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph shall be taken on the basis of a proposal made by the coordinator of that financial conglomerate.
Similarly, for the application of paragraph 3, if the balance sheet total of the smallest financial sector in the group falls below EUR 6 billion for conglomerates already subject to supplementary supervision, a lower figure of EUR 5 billion shall apply for the following three years to avoid sudden regime shifts.
The solvency requirements referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3 shall be calculated in accordance with the provisions of the relevant sectoral rules.

5. Without prejudice to Article 13, the exercise of supplementary supervision at the level of the financial conglomerate shall in no way imply that the competent authorities are required to play a supervisory role in relation to mixed financial holding companies, third-country regulated entities in a financial conglomerate or unregulated entities in a financial conglomerate, on a stand-alone basis.
Article 6
2. The Member States shall require regulated entities in a financial conglomerate to ensure that own funds are available at the level of the financial conglomerate which are always at least equal to the capital adequacy requirements as calculated in accordance with Annex I.
The coordinator shall ensure that the calculation referred to in the first subparagraph is carried out at least once a year, either by the regulated entities or by the mixed financial holding company.
(a) a credit institution, a financial institution or an ancillary banking services undertaking within the meaning of Article 1(5) and (23) of Directive 2000/12/EC;
(d) mixed financial holding companies.
5. The coordinator may decide not to include a particular entity in the scope when calculating the supplementary capital adequacy requirements in the following cases:
(c) if the inclusion of the entity would be inappropriate or misleading with respect to the objectives of supplementary supervision.
When the coordinator does not include a regulated entity in the scope under one of the cases provided for in (b) and (c) of the first subparagraph, the competent authorities of the Member State in which that entity is situated may ask the entity which is at the head of the financial conglomerate for information which may facilitate their supervision of the regulated entity.
1. Without prejudice to the sectoral rules, supplementary supervision of the risk concentration of regulated entities in a financial conglomerate shall be exercised in accordance with the rules laid down in Article 9(2) to (4), in Section 3 of this Chapter and in Annex II.

Where the financial conglomerate is headed by more than one mixed financial holding company with a head office in different Member States and there is a regulated entity in each of these States, the task of coordinator shall be exercised by the competent authority of the regulated entity with the largest balance sheet total if these entities are in the same financial sector, or by the competent authority of the regulated entity in the most important financial sector;
3. In particular cases, the relevant competent authorities may by common agreement waive the criteria referred to in paragraph 2 if their application would be inappropriate, taking into account the structure of the conglomerate and the relative importance of its activities in different countries, and appoint a different competent authority as coordinator. In these cases, before taking their decision, the competent authorities shall give the conglomerate an opportunity to state its opinion on that decision.
1. The tasks to be carried out by the coordinator with regard to supplementary supervision shall include:
(c) assessment of compliance with the rules on capital adequacy and of risk concentration and intra-group transactions as set out in Articles 6, 7 and 8;
(f) other tasks, measures and decisions assigned to the coordinator by this Directive or deriving from the application of this Directive.

Without prejudice to the possibility of delegating specific supervisory competences and responsibilities as provided for by Community legislation, the presence of a coordinator entrusted with specific tasks concerning the supplementary supervision of regulated entities in a financial conglomerate shall not affect the tasks and responsibilities of the competent authorities as provided for by the sectoral rules.
1. The competent authorities responsible for the supervision of regulated entities in a financial conglomerate and the competent authority appointed as the coordinator for that financial conglomerate shall cooperate closely with each other. Without prejudice to their respective responsibilities as defined under sectoral rules, these authorities, whether or not established in the same Member State, shall provide one another with any information which is essential or relevant for the exercise of the other authorities' supervisory tasks under the sectoral rules and this Directive. In this regard, the competent authorities and the coordinator shall communicate on request all relevant information and shall communicate on their own initiative all essential information.

(h) major sanctions and exceptional measures taken by competent authorities in accordance with sectoral rules or this Directive.
(a) changes in the shareholder, organisational or management structure of regulated entities in a financial conglomerate, which require the approval or authorisation of competent authorities;
3. The coordinator may invite the competent authorities of the Member State in which a parent undertaking has its head office, and which do not themselves exercise the supplementary supervision pursuant to Article 10, to ask the parent undertaking for any information which would be relevant for the exercise of its coordination tasks as laid down in Article 11, and to transmit that information to the coordinator.
Information received in the framework of supplementary supervision, and in particular any exchange of information between competent authorities and between competent authorities and other authorities which is provided for in this Directive, shall be subject to the provisions on professional secrecy and communication of confidential information laid down in the sectoral rules.
Member States shall require that persons who effectively direct the business of a mixed financial holding company are of sufficiently good repute and have sufficient experience to perform those duties.
1. Member States shall ensure that there are no legal impediments within their jurisdiction preventing the natural and legal persons included within the scope of supplementary supervision, whether or not a regulated entity, from exchanging amongst themselves any information which would be relevant for the purposes of supplementary supervision.
Verification
The competent authority which made the request may, if it so wishes, participate in the verification when it does not carry out the verification itself.
If the regulated entities in a financial conglomerate do not comply with the requirements referred to in Articles 6 to 9 or where the requirements are met but solvency may nevertheless be jeopardised or where the intra-group transactions or the risk concentrations are a threat to the regulated entities' financial position, the necessary measures shall be required in order to rectify the situation as soon as possible:
Without prejudice to Article 17(2), Member States may determine what measures may be taken by their competent authorities with respect to mixed financial holding companies.

(2) The inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC of these active substances was based on the assessment of the information submitted concerning the proposed use. Information relating to this use has been submitted by certain Member States in accordance with Article 4(1)(f) of Directive 91/414/EEC. The information available has been reviewed and is sufficient to allow certain maximum residue levels (MRLs) to be fixed.
(5) In order to ensure that the consumer is adequately protected from exposure to residues in or on products for which no authorisations have been granted, it is prudent to set provisional MRLs at the lower limit of analytical determination for all such products covered by Directives 86/362/EEC, 86/363/EEC and 90/642/EEC.
(8) The Commission notified this Directive in draft form to the World Trade Organisation and the comments received have been considered in finalising the Directive. The possibility of fixing import tolerance MRLs for specific pesticide/crop combinations will be examined by the Commission on the basis of acceptable data submitted.

In regions where price recording is based on the individual assessment of the weight of lamb carcasses, the conversion shall be based on that assessment.
2. Where there are several representative markets in a quotation area the price for that quotation area shall be the average of the prices recorded on the said markets, weighted by coefficients fixed by the Member States to reflect the relative importance of each market or of each category.

Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1),
Acting in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 251 of the Treaty(4),
(2) Certain tasks currently done at Community or national level could be executed by a specialised expert body. Indeed, there is a need for technical and scientific support and a high level of stable expertise to properly apply the Community legislation in the fields of maritime safety and ship pollution prevention, to monitor its implementation and to evaluate the effectiveness of the measures in place. There is a need therefore, within the Community's existing institutional structure and balance of powers, to establish a European Maritime Safety Agency ("the Agency").
(5) The Agency should favour the establishment of better cooperation between the Member States and should develop and disseminate best practices in the Community. This in turn should contribute to enhancing the overall maritime safety system in the Community as well as reducing the risk of maritime accidents, marine pollution and the loss of human lives at sea.
(8) For the contractual liability of the Agency, which is governed by the law applicable to the contracts concluded by the Agency, the Court of Justice should have jurisdiction to give judgment pursuant to any arbitration clause contained in the contract. The Court of Justice should also have jurisdiction in disputes relating to compensation for any damage arising from the non-contractual liability of the Agency.

Article 24
This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.
laying down health rules concerning animal by-products not intended for human consumption
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1),
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty(3), in the light of the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee on 12 September 2002.
(2) The Scientific Steering Committee has adopted a number of opinions since the adoption of that Directive. Their main conclusion is that animal by-products derived from animals not fit for human consumption following health inspection should not enter the feed chain.
(5) The International Scientific Conference on Meat-and-Bone Meal organised by the Commission and the European Parliament, held in Brussels on 1 and 2 July 1997, initiated a debate concerning the production and feeding of meat-and-bone meal. The Conference called for further reflection on the future policy in this area. In November 1997, to launch the widest possible public debate about the future of the Community's feed legislation, the Commission finalised a consultation paper on meat-and-bone meal. Following that consultation, it appears that there is a general recognition of the need to amend Directive 90/667/EEC to bring it in line with the new scientific information.
(8) Catering waste containing products of animal origin can also be a vector for the spread of disease. All catering waste generated from means of transport operating internationally should be disposed of safely. Catering waste produced within the Community should not be used for the feeding of farmed animals other than fur animals.
(11) Directive 2000/76/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 December 2000 on the incineration of waste(6) does not apply to incineration plants if the waste treated consists solely of animal carcases. It is necessary to lay down minimum requirements for such incineration plants to protect animal and public health. Pending the adoption of Community requirements, Member States may adopt environmental legislation for such plants. Less strict requirements should apply to low-capacity incineration plants, such as those located on farms and at pet crematoria, to reflect the lower risk posed by the material treated and to avoid unnecessary transport of animal by-products.
(14) Derogations may also be appropriate to permit the disposal of animal by-products on site in controlled circumstances. The Commission should receive the information necessary to enable it to monitor the situation and to lay down implementing rules if appropriate.
(17) A wide variety of approaches exists in Member States as regards the financial support for processing, collection, storage and disposal of animal by-products. To ensure that the conditions of competition between agricultural products are not affected, it is necessary to carry out an analysis and, if necessary, to take appropriate measures at Community level.
(20) To ensure that products imported from non-member countries are of a hygiene standard which is at least equal or equivalent to the hygiene standard applied by the Community, a system of approval should be introduced for non-member countries and their establishments, together with a Community inspection procedure to ensure that the conditions for such approval are observed. The importation from third countries of petfood and raw material for petfood can take place subject to conditions different from those applicable to such material produced in the Community, in particular as regards the guarantees required concerning the residues of substances prohibited in accordance with Council Directive 96/22/EC of 29 April 1996 concerning the prohibition on the use in stock farming of certain substances having a hormonal or thyrostatic action and of beta-agonists, and repealing Directives 81/602/EEC, 88/146/EEC and 88/299/EEC(9). To ensure that such petfood and raw material are used only for their intended purpose, it is necessary to lay down appropriate control measures on importation of material covered by such derogations.
(23) Council Directive 92/118/EEC of 17 December 1992 laying down animal health and public health requirements governing trade and imports into the Community of products not subject to the said requirements laid down in specific Community rules referred to in Annex A(I) to Directive 89/662/EEC and, as regards pathogens, to Directive 90/425/EEC(10) pursues the abovementioned objectives.
(26) The products concerned should be subject to the rules for veterinary checks, including checks by experts from the Commission, and any protective measures laid down by Council Directive 90/425/EEC of 26 June 1990 concerning veterinary and zootechnical checks applicable in intra-Community trade in certain live animals and products with a view to the completion of the internal market(11).
(29) To take account of technical and scientific progress, close and effective cooperation should be ensured between the Commission and the Member States within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health set up by Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2002 laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety(15).

correcting Regulation (EC) No 1282/2002 amending Annexes to Council Directive 92/65/EEC laying down animal health requirements governing trade in and imports into the Community of animals, semen, ova and embryos not subject to animal health requirements laid down in specific Community rules referred to in Annex A(1) to Directive 90/425/EEC
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
(1) Regulation (EC) No 1282/2002 was adopted on 15 July 2002 to amend Directive 92/65/EEC.
(4) Regulation (EC) No 1282/2002 should therefore be corrected accordingly.
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 2
of 14 October 2002
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 37 thereof,
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee(3),
(2) Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 defines in Article 13(1) the starting date of the two- and five-year transitional periods as the date of entry into force of the Regulation, namely 21 November 1996. This date is the result of an error; as a matter of fact, eligibility for transitional measures as from the date of entry into force of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 would have been meaningless since Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72 was still in force until 31 December 1996. Instead, the starting date for the transitional periods should have been the date of application of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96.
Article 1
This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
amending Regulation (EEC) No 3149/92 laying down detailed rules for the supply of food from intervention stocks for the benefit of the most deprived persons in the Community
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 3730/87 of 10 December 1987 laying down the general rules for the supply of food from intervention stocks to designated organisations for distribution to the most deprived persons in the Community(1), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 2535/95(2), and in particular Article 6 thereof,
(2) Article 5 of Regulation (EEC) No 3149/92 sets the accounting value of the products made available. This provision should be adapted to take account of changes in the intervention scheme affecting the common organisation of the market in beef and veal.
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
1. the following second subparagraph is added to Article 3(1):"Withdrawal of the products from intervention stocks shall take place from 1 October to 31 August of the following year.";
1. For EAGGF Guarantee Section accounting purposes, and notwithstanding the provisions of Article 8 of Regulation (EEC) No 1883/78(5), the accounting value of the products made available from intervention under this Regulation shall be the intervention price applicable on 1 October of each year.
2. Where intervention products are transferred from one Member State to another, the supplier Member State shall record the product delivered as a zero entry in the accounts and the Member State of destination shall record it as a receipt in the month of dispatch, using the price calculated in accordance with paragraph 1.";
This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
amending Regulation (EC) No 3223/94 on detailed rules for application of the import arrangements for fruit and vegetables
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 of 28 October 1996 on the common organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 545/2002(2), and in particular Article 32(5) thereof,
(2) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for fresh Fruit and Vegetables,
2. The eighth indent is replaced by:
This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
establishing a Committee on Safe Seas and the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (COSS) and amending the Regulations on maritime safety and the prevention of pollution from ships
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1),
Acting in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 251 of the Treaty(4),
(2) By its Resolution of 8 June 1993 on a common policy on safe seas(7), the Council approved in principle the establishment of a Committee on Safe Seas and the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (COSS) and called on the Commission to present a proposal to set up such a committee.
(5) Decision 87/373/EEC has been replaced by Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(8), the provisions of which should therefore be applied to COSS. The purpose of the latter decision is to define the Committee procedures applicable and ensure more comprehensive information to the European Parliament and the public on the work of the committees.
(8) Moreover, the aforesaid legislation is based on the application of rules resulting from international instruments in force at the date of adoption of the Community act in question, or at the date specified by the latter. As a consequence, Member States cannot apply the subsequent amendments to these international instruments until the Community Directives or Regulations have been amended. This has major disadvantages owing to the difficulty of ensuring that the date of entry into force of the amendment at international level coincides with that of the Regulation integrating this amendment into Community law, not least the delayed application within the Community of the most recent and most stringent international safety standards.
(11) For reasons of transparency, the relevant amendments to international instruments that are integrated in Community maritime legislation should be made public in the Community through their publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
The purpose of this Regulation is to improve the implementation of the Community legislation referred to in Article 2(2) on maritime safety, the prevention of pollution from ships and shipboard living and working conditions:
Article 2
(a) Council Regulation (EEC) No 613/91;
(d) Council Directive 94/57/EC of 22 November 1994 on common rules and standards for ship inspection and survey organisations and for the relevant activities of maritime administrations(13);
(g) Council Directive 96/98/EC of 20 December 1996 on marine equipment(15);
(j) Council Directive 98/41/EC of 18 June 1998 on the registration of persons sailing on board passenger ships operating to or from ports of the Member States of the Community(18);
(m) Directive 2001/25/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 April 2001 on the minimum level of training of seafarers(21);
Article 3
2. Where reference is made to this paragraph, Articles 5 and 7 of Decision 1999/468/EC shall apply, having regard to the provisions of Article 8 thereof.
Article 4
Article 5
2. A conformity checking procedure is hereby established in order to exclude from the scope of the Community maritime legislation any amendment to an international instrument only if, on the basis of an evaluation by the Commission, there is a manifest risk that the international amendment, within the scope of the Regulations or the Directives referred to in Article 2(2), will lower the standard of maritime safety, of prevention of pollution from ships or of protection of shipboard living and working conditions established by Community maritime legislation, or be incompatible with the latter.
The Commission shall submit to the COSS, without delay, after the adoption of an amendment to an international instrument a proposal for measures with the aim of excluding the amendment in question from the Community text concerned.

Repeal
Date of application
Addressees
of 14 April 2003
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 80(2) thereof,
Having consulted the Committee of the Regions,
(1) Council Directive 98/18/EC of 17 March 1998 on safety rules and standards for passenger ships(4) introduces a uniform level of safety of life and property on new and existing passenger ships and high-speed passenger craft, when both categories of ships and craft are engaged on domestic voyages, and lays down procedures for negotiation at international level with a view to a harmonisation of the rules for passenger ships engaged on international voyages.
(4) Directive 2003/25/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 April 2003 on specific stability requirements for ro-ro passenger ships(5) introduces strengthened stability requirements for ro-ro passenger vessels operating on international services to and from Community ports, and this enhanced measure should also apply to certain categories of such vessels operating on domestic services under the same sea conditions. Failure to apply such stability requirements should be grounds for phasing out ro-ro passenger ships after a certain number of years of operation.
(7) By virtue of Directive 98/18/EC, the International Code for Safety of High-Speed Craft contained in IMO Maritime Safety Committee Resolution MSC 36 (63) of 20 May 1994 applies to all high-speed passenger craft operating on domestic services. The IMO has adopted a new high-speed craft code, the International Code for Safety of High-Speed Craft, 2000 (2000 HSC Code), contained in IMO Maritime Safety Committee Resolution MSC 97(73) of 5 December 2000, applying to all high-speed craft constructed on or after 1 July 2002. It is important to ensure that Directive 98/18/EC can be updated in a flexible manner to apply such developments at the international level, also to high-speed passenger craft operating on domestic services.
HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:
1. in Article 2 the following points shall be added:
"(w) 'persons with reduced mobility' means anyone who has a particular difficulty when using public transport, including elderly persons, disabled persons, persons with sensory impairments and wheelchair users, pregnant women and persons accompanying small children.";
(a) establish, and update, when necessary, a list of sea areas under its jurisdiction, delimiting the zones for all-year-round operation and, where appropriate, restricted periodical operation of the classes of ships, using the criteria for classes set out in paragraph 1;
3. the following Articles shall be inserted:
1. All ro-ro passenger ships of Classes A, B, and C, the keel of which is laid or which are at a similar stage of construction on or after 1 October 2004 shall comply with Articles 6, 8 and 9 of Directive 2003/25/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 April 2003 on specific stability requirements for ro-ro passenger ships(6).
Safety requirements for persons with reduced mobility
3. For the purpose of modification of passenger ships of Classes A, B, C and D and high-speed passenger craft, used for public transport, the keel of which is laid or which are at a similar stage of construction before 1 October 2004, Member States shall apply the guidelines in Annex III as far as reasonable and practicable in economic terms.
4. Annex III shall be added, as set out in the Annex.
Article 3
Article 4
adapting to technical progress Directive 2000/30/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards speed limiters and exhaust emissions of commercial vehicles
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
(1) Directive 2000/30/EC concerns a legal framework for the roadside inspection of commercial vehicles, whether carrying passengers or freight. It requires Member States to supplement the annual roadworthiness test with unexpected inspections of a representative proportion of the commercial vehicle fleet on their roads each year.
(4) The provisions of this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee on the adaptation to Technical Progress set up pursuant to Article 8 of Directive 96/96/EC,
Annexes I and II to Directive 2000/30/EC are amended as set out in the Annex to this Directive.
When Member States adopt those provisions, they shall contain a reference to this Directive or be accompanied by such a reference on the occasion of their official publication. Member States shall determine how such reference is to be made.
Directive 2003/30/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee(2),
Whereas:
(3) However, there is a wide range of biomass that could be used to produce biofuels, deriving from agricultural and forestry products, as well as from residues and waste from forestry and the forestry and agrifoodstuffs industry.
(6) Greater use of biofuels for transport forms a part of the package of measures needed to comply with the Kyoto Protocol, and of any policy package to meet further commitments in this respect.
(9) Captive fleets offer the potential of using a higher concentration of biofuels. In some cities captive fleets are already operating on pure biofuels and, in some cases, this has helped to improve air quality in urban areas. Member States could therefore further promote the use of biofuels in public transport modes.
(12) Pure vegetable oil from oil plants produced through pressing, extraction or comparable procedures, crude or refined but chemically unmodified, can also be used as biofuel in specific cases where its use is compatible with the type of engines involved and the corresponding emission requirements.
(15) Promoting the use of biofuels in keeping with sustainable farming and forestry practices laid down in the rules governing the common agricultural policy could create new opportunities for sustainable rural development in a more market-orientated common agriculture policy geared more to the European market and to respect for flourishing country life and multifunctional agriculture, and could open a new market for innovative agricultural products with regard to present and future Member States.
(18) Alternative fuels will only be able to achieve market penetration if they are widely available and competitive.
(21) National policies to promote the use of biofuels should not lead to prohibition of the free movement of fuels that meet the harmonised environmental specifications as laid down in Community legislation.
(24) Research and technological development in the field of the sustainability of biofuels should be promoted.
(27) Measures should be introduced for developing rapidly the quality standards for the biofuels to be used in the automotive sector, both as pure biofuels and as a blending component in the conventional fuels. Although the biodegradable fraction of waste is a potentially useful source for producing biofuels, the quality standard has to take into account the possible contamination present in the waste to avoid special components damaging the vehicle or causing emissions to deteriorate.
HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:
Article 2
(b) "biomass" means the biodegradable fraction of products, waste and residues from agriculture (including vegetal and animal substances), forestry and related industries, as well as the biodegradable fraction of industrial and municipal waste;
2. At least the products listed below shall be considered biofuels:
(c) "biogas": a fuel gas produced from biomass and/or from the biodegradable fraction of waste, that can be purified to natural gas quality, to be used as biofuel, or woodgas;
(f) "bio-ETBE (ethyl-tertio-butyl-ether)": ETBE produced on the basis of bioethanol. The percentage by volume of bio-ETBE that is calculated as biofuel is 47 %;
(i) "biohydrogen": hydrogen produced from biomass, and/or from the biodegradable fraction of waste, to be used as biofuel;
1. (a) Member States should ensure that a minimum proportion of biofuels and other renewable fuels is placed on their markets, and, to that effect, shall set national indicative targets.
2. Biofuels may be made available in any of the following forms:
(c) as liquids derived from biofuels, such as ETBE (ethyl-tertio-butyl-ether), where the percentage of biofuel is as specified in Article 2(2).
5. Member States shall ensure that information is given to the public on the availability of biofuels and other renewable fuels. For percentages of biofuels, blended in mineral oil derivatives, exceeding the limit value of 5 % of fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) or of 5 % of bioethanol, a specific labelling at the sales points shall be imposed.
- the measures taken to promote the use of biofuels or other renewable fuels to replace diesel or petrol for transport purposes,
In their first report following the entry into force of this Directive, Member States shall indicate the level of their national indicative targets for the first phase. In the report covering the year 2006, Member States shall indicate their national indicative targets for the second phase.
(b) the amount of resources allocated to the production of biomass for energy uses other than transport and the specific technical or climatic characteristics of the national market for transport fuels;
This report shall cover at least the following:
(c) the life-cycle perspective of biofuels and other renewable fuels, with a view to indicating possible measures for the future promotion of those fuels that are climate and environmentally friendly, and that have the potential of becoming competitive and cost-efficient;
(f) a review of further more long-term options concerning energy efficiency measures in transport.
The list contained in Article 2(2) may be adapted to technical progress in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 6(2). When adapting this list, the environmental impact of biofuels shall be taken into account.
2. Where reference is made to this paragraph, Articles 5 and 7 of Decision 1999/468/EC shall apply, having regard to the provisions of Article 8 thereof.
Article 7
2. Member States shall communicate to the Commission the provisions of national law which they adopt in the field covered by this Directive.
Article 9
of 18 June 2003
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to Council Directive 86/362/EEC of 24 July 1986 on the fixing of maximum levels for pesticide residues in and on cereals(3), as last amended by Directive 2002/79/EC, and in particular Article 10 thereof,
Having regard to Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market(7), as last amended by Commission Directive 2003/39/EC(8), and in particular Article 4(1)(f) thereof,
(2) The new active substances fenhexamid, acibenzolar-S-methyl, cyclanilide, pyraflufen-ethyl, iprovalicarb, prosulfuron, sulfosulfuron, cinidon-ethyl, cyhalofop butyl, famoxadone, florasulam, metalaxyl-M, picolinafen and flumioxazine were included in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC by Commission Directives 2001/28/EC(12), 2001/87/EC(13), 2002/48/EC(14), 2002/64/EC(15) and 2002/81/EC(16).
(5) For the active substances chlorfenapyr, fentin acetate and fentin hydroxide decisions were taken not to include them in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC by Commission Decision 2001/697/EC(17), 2002/478/EC(18) and 2002/479/EC(19), respectively. These Decisions provided that plant protection products containing these active substances shall no longer be authorised for use in the Community. It is therefore necessary to add all of the pesticide residues arising from use of these plant protection products to the Annexes to Directives 86/362/EEC, 86/363/EEC and 90/642/EEC to allow for proper surveillance and control of the prohibition of their uses and to protect the consumer.
(8) With respect to the inclusion in or exclusion from Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC of the active substances concerned, the related technical and scientific evaluations were finalised in the form of Commission review reports. The assessment reports for the substances mentioned were finalised on the dates as mentioned in the Commission Directives cited under (1) and (2) and in the Commission Decisions cited under (5). These reports fixed the acceptable daily intake (ADI) and, if necessary, the acute reference dose (ARfD) for the substances concerned. The lifetime exposure of consumers to food products treated with the active substance concerned has been assessed and evaluated in accordance with Community procedures. Account has also been taken of guidelines published by the World Health Organisation(20) and the opinion of the Scientific Committee for Plants(21) on the methodology employed. It is concluded that MRLs proposed will not lead to those ADIs or ARfD being exceeded.
(11) It is therefore necessary to add all of the pesticide residues arising from use of these plant protection products to the Annexes to Directives 86/362/EEC, 86/363/EEC and 90/642/EEC to allow for proper surveillance and control of the prohibition of their uses and to protect the consumer. The Annexes to Directives 86/362/EEC, 86/363/EEC and 90/642/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.
HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:
Article 2
The maximum pesticide residue levels as shown in Annex II and III to this Directive are added to Annex II A and B to Directive 86/363/EEC.
Article 5
When Member States adopt those provisions, they shall contain a reference to this Directive or be accompanied by such a reference on the occasion of their official publication. Member States shall determine how such reference is to be made.
Article 7
of 28 March 2003
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
(1) The Dutch and English versions of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2603/1999(2), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2055/2001(3), contain a number of errors. Those language versions must therefore be corrected.
1. Concerns only the Dutch version.

Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 laying down rules for the prevention, control and eradication of certain transmissible spongiform encephalopathies(1), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 260/2003(2), and in particular the first subparagraph of Article 23 thereof,
(2) Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 also sets out a list of rapid tests approved for TSE monitoring.
(5) In order to ensure that approved rapid tests maintain the same level of performance after approval a procedure should be laid down for possible modifications to the test or the test protocol.
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 2
of 27 June 2003
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
(1) Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 lays down rules for the monitoring of transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) in ovine and caprine animals, including monitoring of a sample of animals not slaughtered for human consumption. It is necessary to clarify the definition of this group of animals, in order to avoid the inappropriate targeting of samples.
(4) In its opinion of 7 and 8 November 2002 on TSE infectivity distribution in ruminant tissues, the Scientific Steering Committee (SSC) recommended that tonsils of bovine animals of any age should be regarded as posing a risk of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE).
(7) The rules to dispatch carcases, half carcases and quarter carcases containing no specified risk material other than vertebral column to other Member States without the latter's prior agreement should be expanded to half carcases cut into no more than three wholesale cuts reflecting the actual trade between Member States.
(10) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,
Annexes III and XI to Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 are amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.

Whereas:
(3) The report underlined that the cross-country comparison of the labour market will demand more attention in the EMU.
(6) The Action Plan on Economic and Monetary Union Statistical Requirements, endorsed by the Ecofin Council of 29 September 2000, identifies as a priority the transmission of national accounts employment data according to the unit "hours worked".
Article 1
(a) the text of the "Overview of the tables" shall be replaced by the text in Annex I;
Article 2
of 30 October 2003
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 3448/93 of 6 December 1993 laying down the trade arrangements applicable to certain goods resulting from the processing of agricultural products(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2580/2000(2), and in particular the third subparagraph of Article 11(1) thereof,
(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1488/2001(5), should be amended to clarify that, for determining the basic agricultural products to be admitted under inward processing arrangements and for checking and planning the quantities thereof, the procedures set out in Article 16 of Regulation (EC) No 3448/93 are applicable.
Article 1
"2. If the estimated amount needed for refunds exceeds the funds available, the quantities of the various products, as identified by their eight-digit Combined Nomenclature code, shall be determined, in accordance with Article 11(1) of Regulation (EC) No 3448/93, with the aid of the balance."
"Article 24
of 16 December 2003
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 2195/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 November 2002 on the Common Procurement Vocabulary (CPV)(1), and in particular Article 2 thereof,
(2) The structure and codes of the CPV may need to be adapted or amended in the light of developments in the markets and users' needs.
(5) In its opinion(2) on the proposal for a Regulation on the CPV the Committee of the Regions pointed out that the classification of medicines required improvement and recommended the use of the "Anatomic Therapeutic Chemical" (ATC) classification system drawn up by the World Health Organisation to complete the CPV structure and codes for medicinal products.
(8) In the interest of clarity, the CPV should be replaced entirely as well as the correspondence table between the CPV and the CPC Prov. All amendments to the CPV codes or their descriptions should be listed in a separate new Annex to Regulation (EC) No 2195/2002.
(11) For those reasons, it is not appropriate to update the correspondence table between the CPV and the CPA 96 set out in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 2195/2002. That Annex should therefore be deleted.
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Annex I is replaced by the text set out in Annex I to this Regulation;
Annex IV is amended in accordance with Annex IV to this Regulation;
This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.
