THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITY,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 75 (1) thereof;
Having regard to the Opinion of the European Parliament;
Whereas the adoption of a common transport policy involves inter alia laying down common rules for the international carriage of goods by road to or from the territory of a Member State or passing across the territory of one or more Member States;
Whereas the progressive establishment of the common market must not be impeded by obstacles in the transport sector ; whereas it is necessary to ensure a progressive expansion of the international carriage of goods by road, bearing in mind developments in trade and movement of goods within the Community;
HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:
Article 1
1. Each Member State shall, by the end of 1962 at the latest and in the manner laid down in paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Article, liberalise the types of international carriage of goods by road for hire or reward involving other Member States listed in Annexes I and II to this Directive, where such carriage is performed to or from the territory of that Member State or passing in transit across the territory of that Member State.
2. The types of carriage listed in Annex I shall be exempted from any quota or authorisation system.
3. The types of carriage listed in Annex II shall no longer be subject to a quota system. They may, however, remain subject to authorisation provided no quantitative restriction is involved ; in such case Member States shall ensure that decisions on applications for authorisation are given within five days of receipt.
4. The two Annexes to this Directive shall form an integral part thereof.
Article 2
Member States shall inform the Commission of the measures taken to implement this Directive within three months of its entry into force and in any event before the end of 1962.

REGULATION (EEC) No 1397/68 OF THE COMMISSION of 6 September 1968 amending Regulation No 474/67/EEC on the advance fixing of the export refund on rice and broken rice
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community;
Having regard to Council Regulation No 359/67/EEC 1 of 28 July 1967 on the common organisation of the market in rice, and in particular Article 17 (6) thereof;
Whereas, in accordance with Article 17 (4) of Regulation No 359/67/EEC, the refund applicable on the day on which the application for an export licence is made may be applied to an export made during the period of validity of the licence and whereas, in that case, a corrective amount is applied to the refund ; whereas, in accordance with Article 1 of Commission Regulation No 474/67/EEC 2 of 21 August 1967 on the advance fixing of the export refund on rice and broken rice, the corrective amount is equal to the difference between the c.i.f. price and c.i.f. forward delivery price;
Whereas, while export licences for rice and broken rice are valid until the end of the fifth month following that of issue, a truly representative market seldom exists for such products other than on the shortest term or terms ; whereas it should therefore be possible to fix a corrective amount lower than the difference referred to above;
Whereas it is consequently necessary to amend Regulation No 474/67/EEC;
Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the Opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals;
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
The following shall be substituted for the first two subparagraphs of Article 1 of Regulation No 474/67/EEC:
"Where the export refund on rice and broken rice referred to in the first subparagraph of Article 17 (4) of Regulation No 359/67/EEC is fixed in advance, the refund shall be that which is applicable to an export on the day on which the licence is applied for; - reduced by not more than the difference between the c.i.f. forward delivery price and the c.i.f. price when the former exceeds the latter by more than 0 7025 units of account per 100 kilogrammes;
- increased by not more than the difference between the c.i.f. price and the c.i.f. forward delivery price when the former exceeds the latter by more than 0 7025 units of account per 100 kilogrammes
In the intervals between weekly fixings the amount of the refund applicable in the case of advance fixing shall be adjusted only when application of the above-mentioned provision would lead to its amount being altered by more than 0 7025 units of account per 100 kilogrammes."
Article 2
This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 100 thereof;
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission;
Having regard to the Opinion of the European Parliament (1);
Having regard to the Opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (2);
Whereas a regulation of 14 October 1968 amending the Stra√üenverkehrs-Zulassungs-Ordnung was published in Germany in the Bundesgesetzblatt Part I of 18 October 1968 ; whereas that regulation contains provisions on measures to be taken against air pollution by positive-ignition engines of motor vehicles ; whereas those provisions will enter into force on 1 October 1970;
Whereas a regulation of 31 March 1969 on the "Composition of exhaust gases emitted from petrol engines of motor vehicles" was published in France in the Journal officiel of 17 May 1969 ; whereas that regulation is applicable: - from 1 September 1971, to type-approved vehicles with a new type of engine, that is to say, a type of engine which has never before been installed in a type-approved vehicle;
- from 1 September 1972, to vehicles put into service for the first time;
Whereas, on the basis of that communication, each Member State requested to grant national type approval of a type of vehicle must be able to ascertain whether that type has been submitted to the tests laid down in this Directive ; whereas, to this end, each Member State should inform the other Member States of its findings by sending them a copy of the communication completed for each type of motor vehicle which has been tested;
Whereas, furthermore, the technical requirements must be rapidly adapted to take account of technical progress ; whereas, to this end, provision should be made for application of the procedure laid down in Article 13 of the Council Directive of 6 February 1970 on the type approval of motor vehicles and their trailers;
HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:
Article 1
For the purposes of this Directive, "vehicle" means any vehicle with a positive-ignition engine, intended for use on the road, with or without bodywork, having at least four wheels, a permissible maximum weight of at least 400 kg and a maximum design speed equal to or exceeding 50 km/h, with the exception of agricultural tractors and machinery and public works vehicles.

2. The provisions of paragraph 1 shall be revoked as soon as the Council Directive of 6 February 1970 on the type approval of motor vehicles and their trailers enters into force.
Article 4
The Member State which has granted type approval shall take the necessary measures to ensure that it is informed of any modification of a part or characteristic referred to in item 1.1 of Annex I. The competent authorities of that Member State shall determine whether fresh tests should be carried out on the modified prototype and whether a fresh report should be drawn up. Where such tests reveal failure to comply with the requirements of this Directive, the modification shall not be approved.
Article 5
The amendments necessary for adjusting the requirements of Annexes I to VII so as to take account of technical progress shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 13 of the Council Directive of 6 February 1970 on the type approval of motor vehicles and their trailers.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 103 thereof;
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission;
Having regard to the Opinion of the European Parliament;
Having regard to the Opinion of the Economic and Social Committee;
Whereas the establishment of a common energy policy is one of the objectives the Communities have set themselves;
Whereas crude oil and petroleum products are of increasing importance in providing the Community with supplies of energy ; whereas any difficulty, even temporary, having the effect of considerably reducing supplies of such products could cause serious disturbances in the economic activity of the Community ; whereas the Community must, therefore, be in a position to offset or at least to diminish any harmful effects in such a case;
Whereas procedures and appropriate instruments should be provided in advance to ensure the speedy implementation of measures to mitigate the effects of difficulties in the supply of petroleum and petroleum products;
Whereas all Member States should, therefore, possess the necessary powers to take appropriate action, should the need arise, without delay and in accordance with the Treaty, and in particular Article 103 thereof;
Whereas it is necessary for these powers to be harmonized to a certain extent in order to facilitate the coordination of national measures within the framework of consultations at Community level;
Whereas it is also desirable that a consultative body be set up immediately to facilitate the coordination of practical measures taken or proposed by the Member States in this field;
Whereas it is necessary that each Member State draw up a plan which may be used in the event of difficulties arising in the supply of crude oil and petroleum products;
HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:
Article 1
Article 3
1. If difficulties arise with regard to the supply of crude oil and petroleum products in the Community or one of the Member States, the Commission shall convene as soon as possible, at the request of one of the Member States or on its own initiative, a group of delegates from the Member States whose names shall be made known beforehand, under the chairmanship of the Commission.
Article 5
The Member States shall bring into force not later than 30 June 1974 the provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action necessary to comply with this Directive.

REGULATION (ECSC, EEC, EURATOM) No 559/73 OF THE COUNCIL of 26 February 1973 amending Council Regulation (EEC, Euratom, ECSC) No 260/68 of the Council laying down the conditions and procedure for applying the tax for the benefit of the European Communities
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing a Single Council and a Single Commission of the European Communities;
Having regard to the Protocol on the Privileges and Immunities of the European Communities, and in particular Article 13 thereof;
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission;
Whereas, in the light of a recent judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Communities and certain urgent social requirements, it seems desirable to amend a provision of Council Regulation (EEC, Euratom, ECSC) No 260/68 (1) of 29 February 1968 laying down the conditions and procedure for applying the tax for the benefit of the European Communities, as last amended by Regulation (Euratom, ECSC, EEC) No 2531/72 (2);
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
Council Regulation (EEC, Euratom, ECSC) No 260/68 of 29 February 1968 shall be amended as follows:

Article 2
COUNCIL DIRECTIVE of 17 December 1973 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the interior fittings of motor vehicles (interior parts of the passenger compartment other than the interior rear-view mirrors, layout of the controls, the roof or sliding roof, the backrest and rear part of the seats) (74/60/EEC)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 100 thereof;
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission;
Having regard to the Opinion of the European Parliament (1);
Having regard to the Opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (2);
Whereas the technical requirements which motor vehicles must satisfy pursuant to national laws relate, inter alia, to interior fittings for the protection of the occupants;
Whereas these requirements differ from one Member State to another ; whereas it is therefore necessary that all Member States adopt the same requirements either in addition to or in place of their existing regulations in order, in particular, to allow for the EEC type approval procedure, which was the subject of the Council Directive of 6 February 1970 (3) on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the type approval of motor vehicles and their trailers to be applied in respect of each type of vehicle;
Whereas common requirements for interior rear view mirrors have been laid down by the Council Directive of 1 March 1971 (4) and requirements should also be drawn up for the interior fittings of the passenger compartment, the layout of the controls, the roof and backrest and rear part of the seats ; whereas other requirements will be adopted subsequently on interior fittings and relating to the anchorages for safety belts and seats, head restraints, the protection of the driver against the steering unit and the layout of the controls;
Whereas harmonized requirements must reduce the risk or the severity of injuries of which motor vehicle drivers may be victims and thereby ensure road safety throughout the entire Community;
Whereas, with regard to technical requirements, it is appropriate to utilize basically those adopted by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe in its Regulation No 21 ("Uniform requirements concerning the approval of vehicles with regard to their interior fittings") which is annexed to the Agreement of 20 March 1958 concerning the adoption of uniform conditions of approval and reciprocal recognition of approval for motor vehicle equipment and parts,
HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:
Article 1
For the purposes of the Directive, "vehicle" means any motor vehicle in category M1 (defined in Annex I of the Directive of 6 February 1970) designed for use on the road, having at least four wheels and a maximum design speed exceeding 25 km/h.

The competent authorities of that State shall determine whether fresh tests should be carried out on the modified vehicle and a fresh report drawn up. Where such tests reveal failure to comply with the requirement of this Directive, the modification shall not be approved.
Article 5
Modifications which are necessary to adapt the provisions of the Annexes to take account of technical progress shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 13 of the Council Directive of 6 February 1970 on the approximation of the laws of Member States relating to the type approval of motor vehicles and their trailers.

Having regard to the proposal from the Commission;
Having regard to the Opinion of the European Parliament (1);
Having regard to the Opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (2);
Whereas Directive No 64/221/EEC (3) coordinated special measures concerning the movement and residence of foreign nationals which are justified on grounds of public policy, public security or public health and whereas Directive No 75/34/EEC (4) laid down conditions for the exercise of the right of nationals of a Member State to remain in the territory of another Member State after having pursued therein an activity in a self-employed capacity;

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 100 thereof;
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission;
Having regard to the Opinion of the European Parliament (1);
Having regard to the Opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (2);
Whereas, in certain Member States, aerosol dispensers are required to comply with certain mandatory technical specifications ; whereas such specifications differ from one Member State to another and, by so doing, hinder trade within the Community;
Whereas these barriers to the establishment and functioning of the common market can be removed if all the Member States adopt the same specifications, either in addition to or in place of those laid down in their present laws, and whereas these specifications must relate, more particularly, to the manufacture, filling and nominal capacities of aerosol dispensers;
Whereas, at the present stage of technical progress, the field of application of this Directive should be limited to aerosol dispensers made of metal, glass or plastic;

COUNCIL DIRECTIVE of 26 June 1975 amending Directives No 66/400/EEC, No 66/401/EEC, No 66/402/EEC, No 66/403/EEC and No 69/208/EEC on the marketing of beet seed, fodder plant seed, cereal seed, seed potatoes, and seed of oil and fibre plants (75/444/EEC)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Articles 43 and 100 thereof;
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission;
Having regard to the Opinion of the European Parliament (1);
Having regard to the Opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (2);
Whereas, for the reasons given below, certain Directives on the marketing of seeds should be amended;
Whereas it has become apparent, in the course of applying the Directives, that small packages of beet seed and fodder plant seed form an item of trade within the Community;
Whereas it accordingly seems appropriate to harmonize this sector which has hitherto been covered by national legislation;
Whereas in this connection it seems advisable, on the one hand, to facilitate the marking and sealing of such small packages, and on the other hand to make adequate control compulsory for identifying the seed;
Whereas certain of the abovementioned Directives provide that from 1 July 1975 the equivalance of seed harvested in other countries, particularly in third countries, can no longer be established nationally by Member States ; whereas, however, since it has not been possible to carry out Community examination for seed of fodder, oil and fibre plants in all cases, the abovementioned period should be extended for these seeds in order to avoid disturbing current commercial relations;
Whereas it is advisable to authorize Member States to introduce provisions facilitating the sealing of small packages containing cereal seed, seed potatoes and seed of oil and fibre plants;
Whereas it is also necessary to make certain corrections to the way in which the quantities of seed are specified;
HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:
Article 1
Council Directive No 66/400/EEC (3) of 14 June 1966 on the marketing of beet seed, as last amended by Directive No 73/438/EEC (4), shall be amended as follows: 1. The following subparagraph shall be added to Article 2 (1):
"G. Small EEC packages : packages containing the following certified seeds: - monogerm or precision seed : not exceeding 100 000 clusters or grains or a net weight of 2.5 kg excluding, where appropriate, granulated pesticides, pelleting substances or other solid additives;
- seed other than monogerm or precision seed : not exceeding a net weight of 10 kg, excluding, where appropriate, granulated pesticides, pelleting substances or other solid additives." (1)OJ No C 62, 31.7.1973, p. 37. (2)OJ No C 8, 31.1.1974, p. 19. (3)OJ No 125, 11.7.1966, p. 2290/66. (4)OJ No L 356, 27.12.1973, p. 79.
1. Member States shall require that packages of basic seed and certified seed, except where seed of the latter category takes the form of small EEC packages, be officially sealed in such a manner that when the container is opened the seal is damaged and cannot be reattached.
2. Member States shall require that, except in the case of small EEC packages, packages shall not be resealed on one or more occasions unless this is done officially. If packages are resealed, the fact of resealing, the date of resealing and the authority responsible therefor shall be stated on the label required under Article 11 (1).
3. Member States shall require that small EEC packages be sealed in such a manner that when the package is opened the seal is damaged and cannot be reattached. Packages shall not be resealed on one more occasions unless this is done under official supervision.
4. Member States may provide for exceptions to paragraphs 1 and 2 in the case of small packages of basic seed."
4. The following is to be substituted for the introductory section of Article 11 (1):
"1. Member States shall require that packages of basic seed and certified seed, except where seed of the latter category takes the form of small EEC packages ..."
5. The following shall be substituted for the text of Article 11 (2) (b):
"(b) provide for exceptions to paragraph 1 in the case of small packages of basic seed where they are marked : "Passed for marketing in ... (Member State concerned) only"."
6. The following Articles shall be added after Article 11:

REGULATION (EEC) No 2777/75 OF THE COUNCIL of 29 October 1975 on the common organization of the market in poultrymeat
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Articles 42 and 43 thereof;
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission;
Having regard to the Opinion of the European Parliament (1);
Whereas since their adoption the basic provisions concerning the organization of the market in poultrymeat have been amended a number of times ; whereas, by reason of their number, their complexity and their dispersal among various Official Journals, the relevant texts are difficult to use and thus lack the clarity which should be an essential feature of all legislation ; whereas they should therefore be consolidated in a single text;
Whereas the operation and development of the common market in agricultural products must be accompanied by the establishment of a common agricultural policy to include in particular a common organization of agricultural markets, which may take various forms depending on the product;
Whereas the aim of the common agricultural policy is to attain the objectives set out in Article 39 of the Treaty ; whereas, in the poultrymeat sector, in order to stabilize markets and to ensure a fair standard of living for the agricultural Community concerned, provision should be made for measures to facilitate the adjustment of supply to market requirements;
Whereas the creation of a single market for poultrymeat involves the introduction of a single trading system at the external frontiers of the Community, this system to include levies and export refunds;
Whereas to achieve this aim it should as a general rule be sufficient to introduce in respect of imports from third countries levies which take account of the incidence on feeding costs of the difference between prices for feed grain within the Community and on the world market, and of the need to protect the Community processing industry;
Whereas it is necessary to avoid disturbances on the Community market caused by offers made on the world market at abnormally low prices ; whereas to this end sluice-gate prices should be fixed and levies should be increased by an additional amount when free-at-frontier offer prices are lower than those prices;
Whereas provision for a refund on exports to third countries equal to the difference between prices within the Community and on the world market would serve to safeguard Community participation in international trade in poultrymeat ; whereas, in order to give Community exporters a certain amount of security as regards the stability of refunds, provision should be made to enable the refunds on poultrymeat to be fixed in advance;
Whereas, in addition to the system described above, provision should be made for prohibiting in whole or in part, when the situation on the market so requires, the use of inward processing arrangements;
Whereas the establishment of a single market would be jeopardized by the granting of certain aids ; whereas, therefore, the provisions of the Treaty which allow the assessment of aids granted by Member States and the prohibition of those which are incompatible with the common market should be made to apply to poultrymeat;
Whereas the common organization of the market in poultrymeat must take account, in appropriate manner and at the same time, of the objectives set out in Articles 39 and 110 of the Treaty;
Whereas the expenditure incurred by the Member States as a result of the obligations arising out of the application of this Regulation fall on the Community in accordance with the provisions of Articles 2 and 3 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 729/70 (1) of 21 April 1970 on the financing of the common agricultural policy, as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1566/72 (2),

Whereas, in order to protect the environment and public health, it is necessary to reduce the pollution of bathing water and to protect such water against further deterioration;
Whereas surveillance of bathing water is necessary in order to attain, within the framework of the operation of the common market, the Community's objectives as regards the improvement of living conditions, the harmonious development of economic activities throughout the Community and continuous and balanced expansion;
Whereas there exist in this area certain laws, regulations or administrative provisions in Member States which directly affect the functioning of the common market ; whereas, however, not all the powers needed to act in this way have been provided for in the Treaty;
Whereas the programme of action of the European Communities on the environment (3) provides that quality objectives are to be jointly drawn up fixing the various requirements which an environment must meet inter alia the definition of parameters for water, including bathing water;
Whereas, in order to attain these quality objectives, the Member States must lay down limit values corresponding to certain parameters ; whereas bathing water must be made to conform to these values within 10 years following the notification of this Directive;
Whereas it should be provided that bathing water will, under certain conditions, be deemed to conform to the relevant parametric values even if a certain percentage of samples taken during the bathing season does not comply with the limits specified in the Annex;
Whereas, to achieve a certain degree of flexibility in the application of this Directive, the Member States must have the power to provide for derogations ; whereas such derogations must not, however, (1)OJ No C 128, 9.6.1975, p. 13.

Whereas the coordination provided for in Article 54 (3) (g) and in the General Programme for the abolition of restrictions on freedom of establishment, which was begun by Directive 68/151/EEC (3), is especially important in relation to public limited liability companies, because their activities predominate in the economy of the Member States and frequently extend beyond their national boundaries;
Whereas in order to ensure minimum equivalent protection for both shareholders and creditors of public limited liability companies, the coordination of national provisions relating to their formation and to the maintenance, increase or reduction of their capital is particularly important;
Whereas in the territory of the Community, the statutes or instrument of incorporation of a public limited liability company must make it possible for any interested person to acquaint himself with the basic particulars of the company, including the exact composition of its capital;
Whereas Community provisions should be adopted for maintaining the capital, which constitutes the creditors' security, in particular by prohibiting any reduction thereof by distribution to shareholders where the latter are not entitled to it and by imposing limits on the company's right to acquire its own shares;
Whereas it is necessary, having regard to the objectives of Article 54 (3) (g), that the Member States' laws relating to the increase or reduction of capital ensure that the principles of equal treatment of shareholders in the same position and of protection of creditors whose claims exist prior to the decision on reduction are observed and harmonized, (1)OJ No C 114, 11.11.1971, p. 18.

2. Nevertheless, the statutes or instrument of incorporation or the general meeting, the decision of which must be published in accordance with the rules referred to in paragraph 1, may authorize an increase in the subscribed capital up to a maximum amount which they shall fix with due regard for any maximum amount provided for by law. Where appropriate, the increase in the subscribed capital shall be decided on within the limits of the amount fixed, by the company body empowered to do so. The power of such body in this respect shall be for a maximum period of five years and may be renewed one or more times by the general meeting, each time for a period not exceeding five years.
3. Where there are several classes of shares, the decision by the general meeting concerning the increase in capital referred to in paragraph 1 or the authorization to increase the capital referred to in paragraph 2, shall be subject to a separate vote at least for each class of shareholder whose rights are affected by the transaction.

4. Member States may decide not to apply paragraph 2 if all the shares issued in the course of an increase in subscribed capital are issued for a consideration other than in cash to one or more companies, on condition that all the shareholders in the company which receive the consideration have agreed not to have an experts' report drawn up and that the requirements of Article 10 (4) (b) to (f) are met.
Article 28

Article 29
1. Whenever the capital is increased by consideration in cash, the shares must be offered on a pre-emptive basis to shareholders in proportion to the capital represented by their shares.
2. The laws of a Member State: (a) need not apply paragraph 1 above to shares which carry a limited right to participate in distributions within the meaning of Article 15 and/or in the company's assets in the event of liquidation ; or

Any offer of subscription on a pre-emptive basis and the period within which this right must be exercised shall be published in the national gazette appointed in accordance with Directive 68/151/EEC.

The administrative or management body shall be required to present to such a meeting a written report indicating the reasons for restriction or withdrawal of the right of pre-emption, and justifying the proposed issue price. The general meeting shall act in accordance with the rules for a quorum and a majority laid down in Article 40. Its decision shall be published in the manner laid down by the laws of each Member State, in accordance with Article 3 of Directive 68/151/EEC.

Except in the event of a reduction in the subscribed capital, this reserve may not be distributed to shareholders ; it may be used only for offsetting losses incurred or for increasing the subscribed capital by the capitalization of such reserve, in so far as the Member States permit such an operation.
2. In the cases referred to in paragraph 1 the laws of the Member States must at least provide for the measures necessary to ensure that the amounts deriving from the reduction of subscribed capital may not be used for making payments or distributions to shareholders or discharging shareholders from the obligation to make their contributions.
Article 34
The subscribed capital may not be reduced to an amount less than the minimum capital laid down in accordance with Article 6. However, Member States may permit such a reduction if they also provide that the decision to reduce the subscribed capital may take effect only when the subscribed capital is increased to an amount at least equal to the prescribed minimum.
Article 35
Where the laws of a Member State authorize total or partial redemption of the subscribed capital without reduction of the latter, they shall at least require that the following conditions are observed: (a) where the statutes or instrument of incorporation provide for redemption, the latter shall be decided on by the general meeting voting at least under the usual conditions of quorum and majority. Where the statutes or instrument of incorporation do not provide for redemption, the latter shall be decided upon by the general meeting acting at least under the conditions of quorum and majority laid down in Article 40. The decision must be published in the manner prescribed by the laws of each Member State, in accordance with Article 3 of Directive 68/151/EEC;
(b) only sums which are available for distribution within the meaning of Article 15 (1) may be used for redemption purposes;
(c) shareholders whose shares are redeemed shall retain their rights in the company, with the exception of their rights to the repayment of their investment and participation in the distribution of an initial dividend on unredeemed shares.
Article 36
1. Where the laws of a Member State may allow companies to reduce their subscribed capital by compulsory withdrawal of shares, they shall require that at least the following conditions are observed: (a) compulsory withdrawal must be prescribed or authorized by the statutes or instrument of incorporation before subscription of the shares which are to be withdrawn are subscribed for;
(b) where the compulsory withdrawal is merely authorized by the statutes or instrument of incorporation, it shall be decided upon by the general meeting unless it has been unanimously approved by the shareholders concerned;
(c) the company body deciding on the compulsory withdrawal shall fix the terms and manner thereof, where they have not already been fixed by the statutes or instrument of incorporation;

Except in the event of a reduction in the subscribed capital this reserve may not be distributed to shareholders. It can be used only for offsetting losses incurred or for increasing the subscribed capital by the capitalization of such reserve, in so far as Member States permit such an operation;
(e) the decision on compulsory withdrawal shall be published in the manner laid down by the laws of each Member State in accordance with Article 3 of Directive 68/151/EEC.

COUNCIL DIRECTIVE of 25 July 1977 on pure-bred breeding animals of the bovine species (77/504/EEC)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Articles 43 and 100 thereof,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (1),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (2),
Whereas cattle production occupies a very important place in Community agriculture, and satisfactory results depend to a large extent on the use of pure-bred breeding animals;
Whereas most Member States have hitherto endeavoured, as part of their national breeding policies, to promote the production of livestock of a limited number of breeds meeting specific zootechnic standards ; whereas the breeds and standards vary from one Member State to another ; whereas these disparities hinder intra-Community trade;
Whereas, if these disparities are to be removed, thereby increasing agricultural productivity in this sector, intra-Community trade in all pure-bred breeding animals must be progressively liberalized ; whereas complete liberalization of trade requires a later additional harmonization particularly regarding approval for breeding;
Whereas it must be possible for the Member States to insist on pedigree certificates drawn up in accordance with a Community procedure being presented;
Whereas implementing measures in certain technical areas should be taken ; whereas, for the adoption of such measures, a procedure should be provided for establishing close cooperation between Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on Zootechnics ; whereas, until the adoption of those implementing measures, the provisions which are at present in force in the areas in question must remain unchanged;
Whereas it must be ensured that importation of pure-bred breeding animals of the bovine species from non-member countries cannot be carried out on conditions which are less severe than those applied within the Community,
HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:
Article 1
For the purposes of this Directive the following definitions shall apply: (a) pure-bred breeding animal of the bovine species : any bovine animal the parents and grandparents of which are entered or registered in a herd-book of the same breed, and which is itself either entered or registered and eligible for entry in such a herd-book; (1)OJ No C 76, 3.7.1974, p. 52. (2)OJ No C 116, 30.9.1974, p. 33.
(b) herd-book : any book, register, file or data medium - which is maintained by a breeders' organization or association officially recognized by a Member State in which the breeders' organization or association was constituted, and
- in which pure-bred breeding animals of a given breed of the bovine species are entered or registered with mention of their ancestors.
Article 2
The Member States shall ensure that the following shall not be prohibited, restricted or impeded on zootechnical grounds: - intra-Community trade in pure-bred breeding animals of the bovine species,
- intra-Community trade in the semen and embryos of pure-bred breeding animals of the bovine species,
- the establishment of herd-books, provided that they comply with the requirements laid down pursuant to Article 6,
- the recognition of organizations or associations which maintain herd-books, in accordance with Article 6, and
- subject to Article 3, intra-Community trade in bulls used for artificial insemination.
Article 3
The Council, acting on a proposal from the Commission, shall, before 1 July 1980, adopt Community provisions for the approval of pure-bred breeding animals of the bovine species for breeding.
Until the entry into force of such provisions, approval of pure-bred breeding animals of the bovine species for breeding and approval of bulls to be used for artificial insemination as well as the use of semen and embryos shall remain subject to national law, on the understanding that that law may not be more restrictive than that applicable to pure-bred breeding animals of the bovine species, semen and embryos in the Member State of destination.
Article 4
Breeders' organizations or associations officially recognized by a Member State may not oppose the entry in their herd-books of pure-bred breeding animals of the bovine species from other Member States provided that they satisfy the requirements laid down in accordance with Article 6.
Article 5
Member States may require that pure-bred breeding animals of the bovine species and the semen or embryos from such animals shall be accompanied, in intra-Community trade, by a pedigree certificate which complies with a specimen drawn up in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 8, particularly with regard to zootechnical performance.
Article 6
1. The following shall be determined in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 8: - performance monitoring methods and methods for assessing cattle's genetic value,
- the criteria governing the recognition of breeders' organizations and associations,
- the criteria governing the establishment of herd-books,
- the criteria governing entry in herd-books,
- the particulars to be shown on the pedigree certificate.
2. Until the entry into force of the provisions provided for in the first, second and third indents of paragraph 1: (a) the official checks referred to in the first indent of paragraph 1 carried out in each Member State and the herd-books in existence at present shall be recognized by the other Member States;
(b) the recognition of breeders' organizations and associations shall continue to be governed by the rules at present in force in each Member State;
(c) the introduction of new herd-books shall continue to meet the conditions at present in force in each Member State.
Article 7
Until the implementation of Community rules on the subject, the conditions applicable to imports of pure-bred breeding animals of the bovine species from non-member countries must not be more favourable than those governing intra-Community trade.
Member States shall not authorize the import of pure-bred breeding animals of the bovine species from non-member countries unless they are accompanied by a pedigree certificate certifying that they are entered or registered in a herd-book in the exporting non-member country. Proof must be provided that the animals are either entered or registered and eligible for entry in a herd-book in the Community.
Article 8
1. Where the procedure laid down in this Article is to be used, matters shall without delay be referred by the Chairman, either on his own initiative or at the request of a Member State, to the Standing Committee on Zootechnics (hereinafter referred to as "the Committee") set up by the Council Decision 77/505/EEC.
2. Within the Committee the votes of Member States shall be weighted as provided in Article 148 (2) of the Treaty. The Chairman shall not vote.
3. The representative of the Commission shall submit a draft of the measures to be adopted. The Committee shall deliver its opinion on such measures within a time limit set by the Chairman according to the urgency of the matters concerned. Opinions shall be delivered by a majority of 41 votes.
4. The Commission shall adopt the measures and shall apply them immediately where they are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee. Where they are not in accordance with the opinion of the Committee or if no opinion is delivered, the Commission shall without delay propose to the Council the measures to be adopted. The Council shall adopt the measures by a qualified majority.
If, within three months from the date on which the proposal was submitted to it, the Council has not adopted any measures, the Commission shall adopt the proposed measures and apply them immediately save where the Council has decided by a simple majority against those measures.
Article 9
The Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by 1 January 1979 at the latest and shall forthwith inform the Commission thereof.

Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (3),
Whereas, in accordance with Article 3 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 729/70, the general rules for the Community financing of interventions should be laid down;
Whereas, to this end, the list of measures complying with the concept of intervention intended to stabilize the markets should be drawn up;
Whereas it is desirable to lay down that expenditure resulting from intervention measures for which a sum per unit is determined within the framework of a common organization of markets shall be met entirely from Community funds;
Whereas in the case of intervention measures in respect of which a sum per unit is not determined within the framework of the common organization of markets, basic rules should be laid down with regard in particular to the method for determining the amounts to be financed, the financing of expenditure resulting from the tying-up of the funds necessary for intervention purchasing of products, the valuation of stocks to be carried forward from one financial year to the next and the financing of expenditure resulting from storage and, where appropriate, processing operations;
Whereas the various items of expenditure and revenue to be adopted for each sector on the basis of these rules should be the subject of more detailed regulations ; where the financing regulations for each sector should, in the meantime, be maintained in force;
Whereas the general rules for Community financing of interventions should be embodied in a single Regulation ; whereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 2824/72 of 28 December 1972 laying down general rules for the financing of interventions by the Guarantee Section of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (4) should be repealed,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
The measures listed in the Annex shall comply with the concept of intervention intended to stabilize the agricultural markets within the meaning of Article 3 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 729/70.
Article 2
Where, within the framework of a common organization of the market, a sum per unit is determined for an intervention measure, the resulting expenditure shall be met entirely by Community funds.

Article 4
2. The financing of the other intervention measures referred to in Article 3 shall be equal to the expediture, less any revenue, resulting from the intervention measure.
Article 5
In the case of funds originating in the Member States used for intervention purchasing of products, the amount of the interest charges to be financed by the EAGGF, Guarantee Section, shall be calculated using a method and an interest rate uniform throughout the Community, to be determined in accordance with the procedure laid down in accordance with Article 13 of Regulation (EEC) No 729/70. The interest rate must be representative of the interest rates actually paid.
Article 6
Material operations arising from the storage and, where appropriate, processing of intervention products shall be financed by the EAGGF, Guarantee Section, by means of standard amounts uniform throughout the Community, to be laid down in accordance with the procedure provided for in Article 13 of Regulation (EEC) No 729/70 and, where necessary, after examination of the matter by the management committee concerned.
Article 7
Where the products in question have experienced a depreciation as a result of storage, the financial effect thereof shall be recorded and taken into account at the time of entry into intervention. To that end, the coefficients of depreciation and the prices to which they apply shall be determined in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 26 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2727/75 of 29 October 1975 on the common organization of the market in cereals (10), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1254/78 (11), or, as the case may be, in the corresponding Article in the other Regulations on the common organization of agricultural markets, and where necessary, after examination by the EAGGF Committee.
Article 8
In the annual accounts referred to in Article 4 (1), the quantities of products in storage to be carried forward to the following financial year shall, as a rule, be valued at their purchase price. To this end, on the basis of the purchase prices paid by the intervention agencies over a reference period and taking into account the depreciation referred to in Article 7, the price to be applied for quantities to be carried forward to the following financial year shall be determined for the various products in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 13 of Regulation (EEC) No 729/70.
However, if, for a given product, the estimated price on leaving intervention is substantially lower than the value of stocks to be carried forward as determined in accordance with the first subparagraph, a decision may be taken to replace the purchase prices paid by the intervention agencies by another price. The latter price shall be fixed in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 13 of Regulation (EEC) No 729/70, and if necessary after examination by the management committee concerned. It may not be below the average of the purchase prices and the prices obtained on disposal of intervention stocks.
Article 9
Where necessary, detailed implementing rules of this Regulation shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 13 Regulation (EEC) No 729/70.
Article 10

COMMISSION REGULATION (EEC) No 1698/80 of 30 June 1980 supplementing Regulation (EEC) No 797/80 adjusting export levies and refunds fixed in advance in the sugar sector
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 3330/74 of 19 December 1974 on the common organization of the market in sugar (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1396/78 (2), and in particular Articles 17 (5) and 19 (2) and (4) thereof,
Whereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 797/80 of 31 March 1980 adjusting export levies and refunds fixed in advance in the sugar sector (3) provides for an increase in refunds and a decrease in export levies in the case of licences issued prior to 1 July 1980 but used from that date;
Whereas, in the case of export levies, the amount thereof may be lower than the amount of the adjustment in question ; whereas, therefore, in order to avoid any inequality of treatment between operators, it is necessary to supplement the said Regulation by providing that the difference should be considered as an export refund to be granted to the interested party instead of the export levy being charged;
Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Sugar,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
Article 1 of Regulation (EEC) No 797/80 shall be amended as follows: 1. In the first paragraph the phrase "at the request of the party concerned", is deleted.
2. The following is inserted in paragraph 2 as the third subparagraph:
"Where the amount of the export levy is less than the amount of the adjustment, the difference between those two amounts shall be considered as an export refund to be granted to the party concerned. In such a case, the export levy shall not be payable."
Article 2
This Regulation shall enter into force on 1 July 1980.
This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.

Whereas in the interests of road safety the fitting of safety belts and restraint systems complying with Directive 77/541/EEC should henceforth be required for the vehicles in certain M and N categories and permitted and encouraged for vehicles in the other M and N categories by extending the scope of that Directive ; whereas such an extension has been made possible by technical progress in motor-vehicle construction;
Whereas for this purpose Directive 77/541/EEC should be amended;
Whereas amendment of that Directive means adapting to technical progress certain requirements in the Annexes to Directive 77/541/EEC ; whereas the entry into force of the provisions of the present Directive should be made to coincide with that of the provisions which, following adoption of the present Directive, will then be adopted in order to adapt the requirements of the Annexes to Directive 77/541/EEC to technical progress,

Whereas the field of survey of the data network must comprise all the agricultural holdings of a certain economic size, irrespective of any outside work the operator may engage in;
Whereas in order to obtain accounting results that are sufficiently homogeneous at Community level, the returning holdings should be distributed among the various divisions and the various categories of holdings on the basis of a stratification of the field of survey based on the Community typology of agricultural holdings as established by Decision 78/463/EEC (6);
Whereas all the returning holdings surveyed in the Member States for the purposes of recording farm incomes in order to provide guidelines for agricultural policies should belong to the Community data network and the number of returning holdings must be increased accordingly; whereas this number must be able to develop within certain limits and in particular on the basis of developments in the field of agriculture and the information requirements of the common agricultural policy;

Article 31
This Directive is addressed to the Member States.
Having regard to Council Regulation No 136/66/EEC of 22 September 1966 on the establishment of a common organization of the market in oils and fats (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2260/84 (2), and in particular Article 5 (4) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas Article 5 of Regulation No 136/66/EEC introduced a system of production aid for olive oil; whereas this aid in respect of areas under olives at a certain date is granted to growers who are members of the producer organizations specified in Article 20c (1) of Regulation No 136/66/EEC and whose average production is at least 100 kilograms of oil per marketing year and to other growers on the basis of the number and production potential of olive trees and of the yields of such trees, as determined according to a standard method, and provided that the olives produced have actually been harvested;
Whereas, pending the establishing of a register of olive cultivation, aid for the growers concerned should be calculated on the basis of the average yields of olive trees;
Whereas, in order to ensure the proper operation of the system of aid, it is necessary to determine the types of olive oil in respect of which aid is granted;
Whereas, in order to ensure the proper operation of the system aid, the rights and obligations of all those concerned, namely growers producer organizations and associations of producer organizations and also the Member States concerned should be laid down;
Whereas the associations of olive oil producer organizations referred to in Article 20c (2) of the said Regulation must be composed of a minimum number of groups or represent a minimum percentage of national production; whereas these minimum numbers or percentages should be set at levels which enable the special coordination and checking work incumbent on such associations to be carried out in an effective manner;
Whereas Article 20c of the said Regulation specifies that producer organizations and associations of producer organizations should carry out certain verification and coordination tasks; whereas the precise nature of these tasks should therefore be defined;
Whereas, in the interests of proper administration, producer organizations and associations thereof must apply to the competent national authorities for recognition in good time before the beginning of the marketing year; whereas the Member State concerned should decide on their application within a reasonable time;
Whereas, in accordance with Article 20d (1) of the said Regulation, a percentage of the aid may be retained to contribute towards the expenditure incurred by producer organizations and associations thereof on making checks; whereas steps should be taken to ensure that the sums retained are used only for the financing of the tasks provided for in Article 20c (1) and (2) of the said Regulation;
Whereas Article 20d (2) of the said Regulation provides that only associations are to qualify for an advance on the amount of the aid; whereas for reasons of sound management this advance should not exceed a certain percentage of the amount of the aid;
Whereas, in order to ensure the proper operation of the system of production aid for growers who belong to producer organizations, provision should be made for paying aid only in respect of the quantities obtained in approved mills; whereas, for the purposes of approval, the mills concerned should fulfil a number of conditions;
Whereas the aid in question is of considerable advantage to oil producers and represents a financial burden on the Community; whereas, in order to guarantee that the aid is granted only in respect of oil which qualifies therefor, provision should be made for an appropriate system of administrative checks;
Whereas, in the interests of proper administration of the aid system, provision should be made for Member States to determine the quantity of olive oil eligible for aid in cases where the actual production of an olive grower is in doubt;
Whereas experience has shown that, despite the large number of specific checks introduced, the number of growers to be supervised makes detailed and effective checking and verification difficult; whereas it is necessary to resolve these difficulties by setting up in each Member State a computerized file containing all the information needed to facilitate checking and the prompt detection of irregularities,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
As from the 1984/85 marketing year, the general rules laid down in this Regulation shall apply to the granting of the production aid for olive oil referred to in Article 5 of Regulation No 136/66/EEC.
3. The aid shall be granted on application by the parties concerned to the Member State in which the oil has been produced.
4. In the case of olive growers who are members of a producer organization as specified in Article 20c (1) of Regulation No 136/66/EEC and whose average production is not less than 100 kilograms of olive oil per marketing year, the aid shall be granted, in accordance with the first indent of Article 5 (2) of that Regulation, in respect of the quantity of oil actually produced at an approved mill, subject to Article 7.
In the case of other olive growers, the aid shall be granted in accordance with the second indent of Article 5 (2) of Regulation No 136/66/EEC and shall be equal to that resulting from applying the olive yields and oil yields, fixed according to the standard method provided for in Article 18 to the number of olive trees in production.
5. For the 1984/85 and 1985/86 marketing years, producer Member States shall determine which olive growers whose average production is at least 100 kilograms of oil per marketing year are entitled to aid granted according to the quantity of oil actually produced by applying the olive yields and oil yields fixed pursuant to Article 18 to the number of olive tress in production.
6. Before 31 March 1986, the Council, acting by a qualified marjority on a proposal from the Commission, shall lay down the criteria to be applied from the 1986/87 marketing year onwards for determining which olive growers have an average production of at least 100 kilograms of oil per marketing year.

Article 23
This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 43 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),
Whereas, in order to make the health safeguards offered to the consumer uniform, Directive 64/433/EEC (4), as last amended by Directive 83/90/EEC (5), provided for the implementation of health inspections and controls in respect of fresh meat likely to be involved in intra-Community trade;
Whereas, in order to safeguard human and animal health within the Community, Directive 72/462/EEC (6), as last amended by Directive 83/91/EEC (7), provides for health controls to be carried out by the competent authorities of the Member States upon importation of fresh meat and for inspections to be carried out by veterinary experts of the Member States and the Commission within the exporting third countries;
Whereas Directive 64/433/EEC relates only to fresh meat likely to be involved in intra-Community trade; whereas, however, the authorities of the Member States have introduced national controls for fresh meat intended solely for the national market;
Whereas Council Directive 71/118/EEC (8), as last amended by Directive 84/642/EEC (9), makes provision for health inspections and controls for fresh poultrymeat;
Whereas these health inspections and controls give rise to the collection of fees which are at present financed in different ways in the individual Member States; whereas these differences are liable to affect the conditions of competition between lines of production which are for the most part covered by common organizations of the markets;
Whereas, in order to remedy this situation, harmonized rules on the financing of the said health inspections and controls should be laid down;
Whereas, owing to the provisions and administrative procedures of national management and financing, a further two-year period should be granted so as to allow the Hellenic Republic to apply the necessary machinery for collecting the fees relating to inspections and controls,
HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:
Article 1
1. As from 1 January 1986 the Member States shall ensure that:
- fees are collected when the animals referred to in paragraph 2 are slaughtered for the costs occasioned by health inspections and controls,
- in order both to ensure equivalence of treatment as provided for in Article 15 of Directive 71/118/EEC and to cover the costs provided for in Directive 72/462/EEC, provision is made for the collection of a fee on meat referred to in those Directives imported from third countries,
- any direct or indirect refund of fees is prohibited.
1. The Council, acting by a qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission shall, before 1 January 1986, take a decision on the standard level or levels of the fees referred to in the first two indents of Article 1 (1) and on the detailed rules and principles for the implementation of this Directive, and on possible exceptions. However, the levels of fees to be collected for meat coming from slaughterhouses that are not approved under Directive 64/433/EEC shall not be fixed except in connection with the adoption by the Council before that date of rules of inspection for that meat.
2. Member States shall be authorized to collect an amount exceeding the level or levels referred to in paragraph 1 provided that the total fee collected for each Member State remains lower than or equal to the real figure for inspection costs.
Article 3
Before 1 January 1990 the Commission will submit a report on the experience gained, together with proposals for possible amendments to the abovementioned Articles.
Article 4
Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive not later than 1 January 1986. They shall forthwith inform the Commission thereof.
However, the Hellenic Republic shall have an additional period of two years in which to comply with it.
Article 5
This Directive is addressed to the Member States.
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),
Whereas, pursuant to the Treaty, all discriminatory treatment based on nationality with regard to establishment and provision of services is prohibited as from the end of the transitional period; whereas the principle of such treatment based on nationality applies, in particular, to the grant of any authorization required for the practice of certain activities, and also to registration with or membership of professional organizations or bodies;
Whereas it nevertheless seems desirable that certain provisions be introduced to facilitate the effective exercise of the right of establishment;
Whereas, pursuant to Article 54 (3) (h) of the Treaty, the Member States are required not to grant any form of aid likely to distort the conditions of establishment;
Whereas in certain Member States access to certain activities in the field of pharmacy is, apart from the award of the relevant diploma, certificate or other formal qualification, subject to the requirement of additional professional experience; whereas, since there is as yet no convergence of views among the Member States on this point, it is advisable, in order to obviate any difficulties, to recognize as a sufficient condition appropriate practical experience of equal duration acquired in another Member State;
Whereas, under their national policies in the sphere of public health, which seek inter alia to ensure the satisfactory dispensing of medicinal products over their entire territories, certain Member States restrict the number of new pharmacies that may be established, while others have adopted no such provisions; whereas in these circumstances it is premature to provide that the effects of the recognition of diplomas, certificates and other evidence of formal qualifications in pharmacy must also extend to the pursuit of the activities of pharmacist as the controller of a pharmacy open to the public for less than three years; whereas this problem must be re-examined by the Commission and the Council within a certain period;
Whereas, with regard to the possession of a formal certificate of training, since a Directive on the mutual recognition of diplomas does not necessarily imply equivalence in the training covered by such diplomas, the use of such qualifications should be authorized only in the language of the Member State of origin or of the Member State from which the foreign national comes;
Whereas, to facilitate the application of this Directive by the national authorities, Member States may prescribe that, in addition to formal certificates of training, the person who satisfies the conditions of training required by this Directive must provide a certificate from the competent authorities of his country of origin or of the country from which he comes stating that these certificates of training are those covered by the Directive;
Whereas this Directive does not affect the provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action in the Member States which prohibit companies from practising certain activities or impose on them certain conditions for such practice;
Whereas it is difficult to assess the extent to which rules aimed at facilitating freedom of pharmacists to provide services could at present be appropriate; whereas, in these circumstances, it is not advisable to adopt such rules for the time being;
Whereas, with regard to good character and good repute, a distinction should be drawn between the requirements to be satisfied on first taking up the profession and those to be satisfied in order to practise it;
Whereas, as far as the activities of employed persons are concerned, Council Regulation (EEC) No 1612/68 of 15 October 1968 on freedom of movement for workers within the Community (1) lays down no specific provisions relating to good character or good repute, professional discipline or use of title for the professions covered; whereas, depending on the individual Member State, such rules are or may be applicable both to employed and self-employed persons; whereas the activities subject in the Member States to possession of a diploma, certificate or other evidence of formal qualification in pharmacy are pursued by both employed and self-employed persons, or by the same persons in both capacities in the course of their professional career; whereas, in order to encourage as far as possible the free movement of those professional persons within the Community, it therefore appears necessary to extend the application of this Directive to employed persons.
HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:
Article 1
Article 2
1. Each Member State shall recognize the diplomas, certificates and other formal qualifications listed in Article 4 awarded to nationals of Member States by other Member States in accordance with Article 2 of Directive 85/432/EEC by giving such qualifications, as regards the right of access to and pursuit of the activities referred to in Article 1, the same effect in its territory as those diplomas, certificates and other formal qualifications, listed in Article 4, which it itself awards.
2. However, Member States need not give effect to the diplomas, certificates and other formal certificates referred to in paragraph 1 with respect to the establishment of new pharmacies open to the public. For the purposes of applying this Directive, pharmacies which have been in operation for less than three years shall also be regarded as new.
Five years after the date stipulated in Article 19 (1), the Commission shall submit a report to the Council on the way in which Member States have implemented the preceding subparagraph and on the possibility of extending the effects of mutual recognition of the diplomas, certificates and other formal certificates referred to in paragraph 1. It shall make any appropriate proposals.
Article 3
1. By way of derogation from Article 2 and without prejudice to Article 45 of the 1979 Act of Accession, the Hellenic Republic shall not be required to give effect as laid down in Article 2 to the diplomas, certificates and other formal qualifications awarded by other Member States except in the case of the pursuit as an employed person in accordance with Regulation (EEC) No 1612/68 of the activities referred to in Article 1.
As long as the Hellenic Republic makes use of this derogation and without prejudice to Article 45 of the 1979 Act of Accession, the other Member States shall not be required to give effect as provided for in Article 2 to the certificates referred to in Article 4 (d) except in the case of the pursuit as an employed person in accordance with Regulation (EEC) No 1612/68 of the activities referred to in Article 1.
2. Ten years after the date stipulated in Article 19, the Commission shall submit to the Council appropriate proposals in order to extend the effects of mutual recognition of diplomas, certificates and other formal qualifications with a view to facilitating the effective exercise of the right of establishment between the Hellenic Republic and the other Member States. The Council shall act on these proposals in accordance with the procedure laid down in the EEC Treaty.

- they are accompanied by a certificate stating that their holders have been effectively and lawfully engaged in one of the activities referred to in Article 1 (2) of Directive 85/432/EEC in a Member State for at least three consecutive years during the five years preceding the award of the certificate, provided that this activity is regulated in that State.

COUNCIL DIRECTIVE of 20 December 1985 on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS) (85/611/EEC)
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament(2),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee(3),
Whereas the laws of the Member States relating to collective investment undertakings differ appreciably from one state to another, particularly as regards the obligations and controls which are imposed on those undertakings ; whereas those differences distort the conditions of competition between those undertakings and do not ensure equivalent protection for unit-holders;
Whereas, having regard to these objectives, it is desirable that common basic rules be established for the authorization, supervision, structure and activities of collective investment undertakings situated in the Member States and the information they must publish ;
Whereas the application of these common rules is a sufficient guarantee to permit collective investment undertakings situated in Member States, subject to the applicable provisions relating to capital movements, to market their units in other Member States without those Member States' being able to subject those undertakings or their units to any provision whatsoever other than provisions which, in those states, do not fall within the field covered by this Directive; whereas, nevertheless, if a collective investment undertaking situated in one Member State markets its units in a different Member State it must take all necessary steps to ensure that unit-holders in that other Member State can exercise their financial rights there with ease and are provided with the necessary information,
Whereas the coordination of the laws of the Member States should be confined initially to collective investment undertakings other than of the closed-ended type which promote the sale of their units to the public in the Community and the sole object of which is investment in transferable securities (which are essentially transferable securities officially listed on stock exchanges or similar regulated markets); whereas regulation of the collective investment undertakings not covered by the Directive poses a variety of problems which must be dealt with by means of other provisions, and such undertakings will accordingly be the subject of coordination at a later stage ; whereas pending such coordination any Member State may, inter alia, prescribe those categories of undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS) excluded from this Directive's scope on account of their investment and borrowing policies and lay down those specific rules to which such UCITS are subject in carrying on their business within its territory;
Whereas the free marketing of the units issued by UCITS authorized to invest up to 100 % of their assets in transferable securities issued by the same body (State, local authority, etc.) may not have the direct or indirect effect of disturbing the functioning of the capital market or the financing of the Member States or of creating economic situations similar to those which Article 68 (3) of the Treaty seeks to prevent;
Whereas account should be taken of the special situations of the Hellenic Republic's and Portuguese Republic's financial markets by allowing those countries and additional period in which to implement this Directive,
HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE :
Section I General provisions and scope
3. Such undertakings may be constituted according to law, either under the law of contract (as common funds managed by management companies) or trust law (as unit trusts) or under statute (as investment companies).
For the purposes of this Directive 'common funds' shall also include unit trusts.
4. Investment companies the assets of which are invested through the intermediary of subsidiary companies mainly otherwise than in transferable securities shall not, however, be subject to this Directive.

6. Subject to the provisions governing capital movements and to Articles 44, 45 and 52 (2) no Member State may apply any other provisions whatsoever in the field covered by this Directive to UCITS situated in another Member State or to the units issued by such UCITS, where they market their units within its territory.
7.

Liability to unit-holders may be invoked either directly or indirectly through the management company, depending on the legal nature of the relationship between the depositary, the management company and the unit-holders.

This Directive is addressed to the Member States.
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 235 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),
Whereas a harmonious development of economic activities and a continuous and balanced expansion throughout the Community depend on the establishmend and smooth functioning of a common market offering conditions analogous to those of a national market; whereas to bring about this single market and to increase its unity a legal framework which facilitates the adaptation of their activities to the economic conditions of the Community should be created for natural persons, companies, firms and other legal bodies in particular; whereas to that end it is necessary that those natural persons, companies, firms and other legal bodies should be able to cooperate effectively across frontiers;
Whereas cooperation of this nature can encounter legal, fiscal or psychological difficulties; whereas the creation of an appropriate Community legal instrument in the form of a European Economic Interest Grouping would contribute to the achievement of the abovementioned objectives and therefore proves necessary;
Whereas the Treaty does not provide the necessary powers for the creation of such a legal instrument;
Whereas a grouping's ability to adapt to economic conditions must be guaranteed by the considerable freedom for its members in their contractual relations and the internal organization of the grouping;
Whereas a grouping differs from a firm or company principally in its purpose, which is only to facilitate or develop the economic activities of its members to enable them to improve their own results; whereas, by reason of that ancillary nature, a grouping's activities must be related to the economic activities of its members but not replace them so that, to that extent, for example, a grouping may not itself, with regard to third parties, practise a profession, the concept of economic activities being interpreted in the widest sense;
Whereas access to grouping form must be made as widely available as possible to natural persons, companies, firms and other legal bodies, in keeping with the aims of this Regulation; whereas this Regulation shall not, however, prejudice the application at national level of legal rules and/or ethical codes concerning the conditions for the pursuit of business and professional activities;
Whereas this Regulation does not itself confer on any person the right to participate in a grouping, even where the conditions it lays down are fulfilled;
Whereas the power provided by this Regulation to prohibit or restrict participation in grouping on grounds of public interest is without prejudice to the laws of Member States which govern the pursuit of activities and which may provide further prohibitions or restrictions or otherwise control or supervise participation in a grouping by any natural person, company, firm or other legal body or any class of them;
Whereas, to enable a grouping to achieve its purpose, it should be endowed with legal capacity and provision should be made for it to be represented vis-√†-vis third parties by an organ legally separate from its membership;
Whereas the protection of third parties requires widespread publicity; whereas the members of a grouping have unlimited joint and several liability for the grouping's debts and other liabilities, including those relating to tax or social security, without, however, that principle's affecting the freedom to exclude or restrict the liability of one or more of its members in respect of a particular debt or other liability by means of a specific contract between the grouping and a third party;
Whereas matters relating to the status or capacity of natural persons and to the capacity of legal persons are governed by national law;
Whereas the grounds for winding up which are peculiar to the grouping should be specific while referring to national law for its liquidation and the conclusion thereof;
Whereas groupings are subject to national laws relating to insolvency and cessation of payments; whereas such laws may provide other grounds for the winding up of groupings;
Whereas this Regulation provides that the profits or losses resulting from the activities of a grouping shall be taxable only in the hands of its members; whereas it is understood that otherwise national tax laws apply, particularly as regards the apportionment of profits, tax procedures and any obligations imposed by national tax law;
Whereas in matters not covered by this Regulation the laws of the Member States and Community law are applicable, for example with regard to:
- social and labour laws,
- competition law,
- intellectual property law;
Whereas the activities of groupings are subject to the provisions of Member States' laws on the pursuit and supervision of activities; whereas in the event of abuse or circumvention of the laws of a Member State by a grouping or its members that Member State may impose appropriate sanctions;
Whereas the Member States are free to apply or to adopt any laws, regulations or administrative measures which do not conflict with the scope or objectives of this Regulation;
Whereas this Regulation must enter into force immediately in its entirety; whereas the implementation of some provisions must nevertheless be deferred in order to allow the Member States first to set up the necessary machinery for the registration of groupings in their territories and the disclosure of certain matters relating to groupings; whereas, with effect from the date of implementation of this Regulation, groupings set up may operate without territorial restrictions,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:

Article 16
This Regulation shall enter into force on 1 July 1986.
This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.
Whereas Article 30 et sequitur of the Treaty, concerning the elimination of quantitative restrictions and all measures having equivalent effect, apply without distinction to products originating in the Community and those that have been put into free circulation in any of the Member States irrespective of their origin;
Whereas under these arrangements the requirement, be it purely formal, in intra-Community trade of an import licence or any similar procedure is prohibited;
Whereas, in addition, Article 9 (2) of the Treaty precludes any administrative procedure designed to establish different rules for the movement of goods according to whether they originate in the Community or originated in third countries and have been put into free circulation in one of the Member States;
Whereas, however, the full application of these principles presupposes the effective establishment of a common commercial policy;
Whereas the establishment of a common commercial policy is not yet complete; whereas the measures applied by the Member States in respect of some products from third countries have not yet been replaced by uniform common rules;
Whereas the fact that the common commercial policy has not yet been fully established means that there will still be disparities among the Member States' commercial policies which are likely to cause deflections of trade, which Article 115 of the Treaty is designed to prevent;
Whereas to this end the Commission is empowered to authorize the Member States to take intra-Community surveillance measures or protective measures, notwithstanding the principle of free movement within the Community of goods originating in third countries and put into free circulation in one of the Member States; whereas, however, Article 115 provides that these measures can be authorized only where necessary and that the Commission shall give priority to those measures which cause least disturbance to the functioning of the common market; whereas the result is that at the present stage of establishment of the common market the measures under Article 115 of the Treaty should be authorized only where deflections of trade lead to economic difficulties or jeopardize the effectiveness of commercial policy measures taken by Member States pursuant to the Community's international obligations;
Whereas the Single European Act provides for the establishment, as from 1 January 1993, of an area without internal frontiers in which goods, services and capital will be able to move freely; whereas this implies, on the one hand, that the disparities still existing among commercial policies applied by the Member States shall be progressively eliminated or reduced and, on the other, that the Commission must be fully aware of these objectives when assessing the need to authorize measures pursuant to Article 115 of the Treaty; Whereas, by its Decision 80/47/EEC of 20 December 1979 on surveillance and protective measures which Member States may be authorized to take in respect of imports of certain products originating in third countries and put into free circulation in another Member State (1) the Commission established certain criteria and procedures to be followed in implementing Article 115 of the Treaty;
Whereas, in view of past experience and the action programme the Community has set itself to establish the single market, Decision 80/47/EEC should be amended and in particular its scope should be extended to all those cases where disparities exist in commercial policy measures taken by the Member States in compliance with the Treaty, including cases where disparities in tariff measures are still authorized, and some of the criteria and procedures it lays down should be made more specific; whereas in order to accommodate these amendments the aforesaid Decision should be recast as a single act;
Whereas, in cases where a surveillance measure is authorized, import documents must be issued automatically, free of charge, within a given period and for any quantity requested; whereas if surveillance measures are requested on the grounds that imports may lead in a Member State to economic difficulties, the reality of such danger should be assessed in the light of deflections of trade observed in the past and the level of the import opportunities granted by the Community to the third country in question;
Whereas, should a Member State request authorization to apply protective measures, the time limit for the issue of import documents must be extended if the volume covered by the applications for documents pending reaches a certain level;
Whereas the information and grounds supplied by the Member States in support of requests for authorization to introduce the measures in question must be such as to enable the Commission to assess fully the need for such authorization;
Whereas it should be provided that, if necessary, the Commission may hold an inquiry to check the validity of the information at its disposal;
Whereas the measures adopted pursuant to Article 115 of the Treaty, by virtue of the fact that they not only constitute an exception from the provisions of Articles 9 and 30 of the Treaty but also hamper the establishment of a common commercial policy as laid down in Article 113 of the Treaty, must be interpreted and applied strictly; whereas, to take account of this and also of the objectives laid down by the Single European Act, such measures should be applied only for a limited period and where the gravity of the situation so warrants;
Whereas in order to ensure that intra-Community trade is not hampered it should be provided that the Member States, as a general rule, must request from the importer, as part of the completion of formalities connected with the import of a product from another Member State, only certain information and data; whereas, as regards checks on origin, the Member States as a general rule must ask only for a simple statement of the origin of the product as the importer can be reasonably expected to know it,
HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:
Article 1
Scope
This Decision shall apply to imports into a Member State of products originating in a third country and put into free circulation in the Community which are not subject to uniform conditions of import in the Member States.
Article 2
Intra-Community surveillance

(f) supporting evidence that the product is in free circulation: if the products are not yet in free circulation on the date when the application for importation is made or if the supporting evidence cannot be provided by this date, the import document shall be granted but its validity shall be limited to one month following receipt of the document by the applicant.
Article 3
Protective measures
1. Where imports into a Member State of a product referred to in Article 1 give rise to economic difficulties, the Member State in question may take protective measures after obtaining authorization by the Commission, which shall determine the conditions and details of such measures.
2. The Commission shall only grant authorization for a limited period and where the gravity of the situation so warrants.
3. For the purpose of obtaining authorization the Member State shall supply in its request to the Commission the following particulars and data, in addition to those referred to in Article 2 (4) (a) and (b):
(a) the exporting Member State;

- the maximum period for the issue of import documents shall be increased to 10 working days from the date of the application by the importer,
- the Member State may reject the application for import documents if the Commission's decision authorizes it to do so.
6. The Member State shall make the request for protective measures by telex or telefax. A copy shall be sent simultaneously and by the same means to the relevant departments designated by the other Member States for that purpose. It shall inform applicants for import documents of the introduction of a request for protective measures.
7. The Commission shall decide on the Member State's request within five working days of its receipt.
Article 4
Proof of origin
1. As part of completion of formalities in connection with the import of products which are subject to intra-Community surveillance measures or protective measures, the relevant authorities of the importing Member State may ask the importer to state the origin of the products on the customs declaration or on the application for an import document.

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 100 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2),
Whereas Directive 70/156/EEC (3), as last amended by the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal, laid down the Community type-approval procedure for vehicles built in compliance with the technical requirements set out in specific directives and also the list of vehicle parts and characteristics covered by those directives;
Whereas, in order to eliminate the possibility of misinterpretation arising from the wording of certain Articles of that Directive, it is necessary that minor corrections be made;
Whereas, in order that the said type-approval procedure may be comprehensive in its application, it is necessary that it cover components as well as separate technical units and that each concept should be accurately defined;
Whereas, in order to apply the said type-approval procedure correctly, control of the conformity of production should include verification of the arrangements which have been made by the manufacturer to ensure that vehicles, separate technical units or components in production conform to the approved type;
Whereas, to reduce the amount of documentation now in circulation between Member States, the type-approval certificate, either in accordance with the relevant separate directive or the partially-completed type-approval certificate as annexed to Directive 70/156/EEC, should satisfy the normal information requirements of Member States, which have the option of requesting a more complete body of technical information;
Whereas the administrative procedures governing the relationships between Member States, where one Member State demonstrates to the type-approving Member State that a number of vehicles do not conform to the approved type and that there is therefore reason to believe that production conformity has not been adequately ensured, need to be clarified;
Whereas, in cases where the separate directives provide that a separate technical unit must bear the type-approval number, it should not be mandatory that each unit be accompanied by a certificate of conformity; whereas a manufacturer of a separate technical unit should in any case be required to provide information concerning any restrictions on its use and conditions relating to the fitting of the unit,
HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:
Article 1
Directive 70/156/EEC is hereby amended as follows:
For the purposes of this Directive:
- "vehicle" means any motor vehicle intended for use on the road, with or without bodywork, having at least four wheels and a maximum design speed exceeding 25 km/h, and its trailers, with the exception of vehicles which run on rails and of agricultural tractors and machinery,
- "separate technical unit" means a device, subject to the requirements of a separate directive, intended to be part of a vehicle which may be type-approved separately but only in relation to one or more specified types of vehicles,
- "component" means a device, subject to the requirements of a separate directive, intended to be part of a vehicle which may be type-approved independently of a vehicle.

- "aprova√ß√£o de marca e modelo" in Portuguese law,
- "type approval" in United Kingdom law.
(b) "EEC type-approval" means the procedure whereby a Member State certifies that a vehicle type, separate technical unit or component satisfies the technical requirements of the separate directives and the checks listed in the EEC type-approval certificate, the model of which is given in Annex II, and, where applicable, completed by the Annex to the type-approval certificate as contained in the appropriate separate Directives.'
2. Articles 4 and 5 are replaced by the following:
'Article 4
1. Each Member State shall approve all vehicle types which satisfy the following conditions:
(a) the vehicle type must conform to the particulars in the information document;
(b) the vehicle type must satisfy the checks listed in the model, referred to in Article 2 (b), of the type-approval certificate.
2. A Member State granting type-approval shall take the necessary measures to verify, in so far as is necessary and if need be in cooperation with the competent authorities of the other Member States, that adequate arrangements have been made to ensure that vehicles in production conform to the approved type.
3. A Member State which has granted type-approval shall take the necessary measures to verify, in so far as is necessary and if need be in cooperation with the competent authorities of the other Member States, that the arrangements referred to in paragraph 2 continue to be adequate and that production models conform to the approved type. Verification that production models conform to the approved type shall be limited to spot checks, unless specified otherwise in the separate directives.
4. Each Member State shall complete all the sections of a type-approval certificate for each vehicle type which it approves.
Article 5
1. The competent authorities of each Member State shall, within one month, send the competent authorities of the other Member States a copy of the type-approval certificate for each vehicle type which they approve or refuse to approve.
2. Member States may, however, request from a Member State which has granted type-approval or the manufacturer or his authorized representative, further information contained in the technical documents listed in the type-approval certificate.
3. The manufacturer or his authorized representative in the country of registration shall complete a certificate of conformity, the model of which is given in Annex III, for each vehicle manufactured in conformity with the approved type.
4. Article 7 (2) is replaced by the following:
'2. Nevertheless, this certificate shall not prevent a Member State from taking such measures in respect of vehicles which do not conform to the approved type.

A vehicle shall not be considered to deviate from the approved type where tolerances are permitted by separate directives and these tolerances are respected.'
5. Article 8 is replaced by the following:
'Article 8
1. If a Member State which has granted EEC type-approval finds that a number of vehicles accompanied by a certificate of conformity do not conform to the type which it has approved, it shall take the necessary measures to ensure that production models once more conform to the approved type. The competent authorities of that State shall advise those of the other Member States of the measures taken, which may, where necessary, extend to withdrawal of EEC type-approval. 2. If a Member State demonstrates that a number of vehicles accompanied by a certificate of conformity do not conform to the approved type it may request the Member State which granted the EEC type-approval to verify that production models conform to the approved type. The Member State which granted the EEC type-approval shall conduct the requested conformity of production check, within six months of the date of request, with, if it is considered necessary, the cooperation of the Member State which requested that such a check be conducted.
Where a failure to conform has been established, the competent authorities of the Member State which granted type-approval shall take the measures outlined in paragraph 1.
3. The competent authorities of the Member States shall inform each other within one month of any withdrawal of EEC type-approval, and of the reasons for such measure.
4. If the Member State which granted EEC type-approval disputes the failure to conform notified to it, the Member States concerned shall endeavour to settle the dispute.
The Commission shall be kept informed and shall, where necessary, hold appropriate consultations for the purpose of reaching a settlement.'
6. Article 9a is amended as follows:
'Article 9a
1. Where the separate directives make express provision for so doing, EEC type-approval may also be granted to types of systems or parts of vehicles which form a separate technical unit and to components in accordance with Articles 3 to 9 and 14.
2. Where the separate technical unit or the component to be approved fulfils its function or offers a specific feature only in conjunction with other components of the vehicle and for this reason compliance with one or more requirements can be verified only when the separate technical unit or the component to be approved operates in conjunction with other vehicle components, whether real or simulated, the scope of the EEC type-approval of the separate technical unit or component must be restricted accordingly. The EEC type-approval certificate for a separate technical unit or component shall then include any restrictions on its use and shall indicate any conditions for fitting it. Observance of these restrictions and conditions shall be verified at the time of EEC type-approval of the vehicle.
3. However, the holder of EEC type-approval for a separate technical unit or a component granted in accordance with this Article shall complete the certificate provided for in Article 5 (3) and affix to each unit or component manufactured in conformity whith the approved type the trade name or mark, the type and, if the separate directive so provides, the type-approval number. In the latter case, these shall be no obligation to complete the certificate provided for in Article 5 (3).
4. The holder of an EEC type-approval certificate which, in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 2, includes restrictions on its use, shall deliver with each unit or component manufactured detailed information on these restrictions and shall indicate any conditions for fitting it.'
7. The third indent of Article 10 (1) is replaced by the following:
'- on application by the manufacturer or his authorized representative and on submission of the information required by the separate directive, the Member State concerned shall complete the type approval certificate in accordance with the relevant separate directive. A copy of this certificate shall be issued to the applicant. With respect to vehicles of the same type, other Member States shall accept this copy as proof that the requisite tests have been carried out.'
Article 2
The documents listed in the Annex to this Directive shall be considered to be equivalent to the type-approval certificate to which reference is made in the third indent of Article 10 (1) of Directive 70/156/EEC.
Article 3
1. Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by 1 October 1988. They shall forthwith inform the Commission thereof.
2. Member States shall arrange to forward to the Commission the text of the essential domestic legal provisions which they adopt in the field covered by this Directive.
Article 4
This Directive is addressed to the Member States.
Having regard to Council Directive 79/117/EEC of 21 December 1978 prohibiting the placing on the market and use of plant protection products containing certain active substances (1), as last amended by Directive 87/181/EEC (2), and in particular Article 6 thereof,
Whereas the development of scientific and technical knowledge makes necessary certain amendments to the Annex to Directive 79/117/EEC;
Whereas it seems desirable to delete a certain number of temporary derogations from the prohibitions laid down in the Directive since less hazardous treatments are now available;
Whereas all Member States have informed the Commission that they do not intend or no longer intend to avail themselves of these derogations;
Whereas the measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plant Health,
HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:
(b) under item 5, 'Alkoxyalkyl and aryl mercury compounds', the text in column 2 is replaced by: 'Seed treatment of cereals and beet';

Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas Article 13 of Regulation (EEC) No 2261/84 (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3788/85 (4), provides that provisional approval may be granted to mills that submit an application for approval during the 1984/1985 and 1985/1986 marketing years; whereas experience has shown that the Member States concerned are unable to carry out the checks required within the period laid down; whereas these periods should therefore be extended;
Whereas, before being able to grant definitive approval to a mill, Member States must carry out certain checks; whereas, in order to enable the mill to begin operation, provision should be made to grant provisional approval for a limited period as soon as the application has been submitted,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
The first subparagraph of Article 13 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 2261/84 is hereby replaced by the following:

Whereas Regulation (EEC) No 3761/83(4) introduced the system of certificates of origin provided for by the International Coffee Agreement 1983 when quotas are in effect;
Whereas appropriate measures must be taken to implement the new system of certificates within the Community and to provide that it be applied without discrimination between Community importers;
Whereas in order to ensure the efficient administration of the system and to clarify the position regarding the periods during when this Regulation will actually apply and in order to conform to Rule 11 of the Annex to this Regulation and to Rule 17 of the Annex to Regulation (EEC) No 3761/83, provision should be made for the Commission, in accordance with the decisions taken by the competent bodies of the International Coffee Organization and at the time when quotas are suspended or reintroduced, to specify the date on which the measures in question become applicable or cease to be applicable,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Exports from the Community of coffee and of extracts, essences or concentrates of coffee falling within subheadings 09.01 A and 21.02 A of the Common Customs Tariff shall not be subject to submission of the certificates provided for in the Agreement.
This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 170/83 of 25 January 1983 establishing a Community system for the conservation and management of fishery resources (1),
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 3094/86 of 7 October 1986, laying down certain technical measures for the conservation of fishery resources (2), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 4026/86 (3), and in particular Article 15 thereof,
Whereas Article 6 (3) of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3440/84 (4) provides for the attachment of a strengthening bag to trawls, Danish seines and similar nets provided that its mesh size shall in no case be less than 80 millimetres;
Whereas experience has shown that the use of strengthening bags having this mesh size with nets having a mesh size less than 40 millimetres results in the formation of pockets of net with consequent damage to the catch due to technical problems in removing the catch from the codend and with consequent wear and tear of the codend;
Whereas the use of a strengthening bag with a smaller mesh size would avoid these problems without having adverse consequences for the conservation of fish stocks;
Whereas the definitions of categories of nets in Articles 5 and 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 3440/84 therefore need to be amended;
Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Fishery Resources,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
Regulation (EEC) No 3440/84 is hereby amended as follows:
1. Article 5 (5) is replaced by the following:
'5. It is prohibited to use a top-side chafer together with strengthening bags except for trawls having a mesh size equal to or less than 60 millimetres'.
2. Article 6 is modified as follows:
- Paragraph 2 is replaced by the following text:
'2. It is prohibited to use more than one strenthening bag except when attached to trawls having a mesh size equal to or less than 60 millimetres, for which two strenthening bags may be used.';
- Paragraph 3 is replaced by the following text:
'3. The mesh size shall be equal to at least twice that of the codend. If a second strengthening bag is used, its minimum mesh size shall be 120 millimetres.';
- Paragraph 6 is replaced by the following text:
'6. Strengthening bags attached to trawls having a mesh size greater than 60 millimetres shall not extend more than two metres in front of the rear lifting strap.';
- Paragraph 7 is replaced by the following text:
'7. Notwithstanding paragraph 1, strengthening bags smaller than the dimensions of the codend may be attached to nets having a mesh size equal to or less than 60 millimetres.'.
Article 2
This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.

Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1898/87 of 2 July 1987 on the protection of designations used in marketing of milk and milk products (1), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 222/88 (2), and in particular Article 4 (2) (b) thereof,
Whereas Regulation (EEC) No 1898/87 establishes the principle that the descriptions ¬¥milk' and ¬¥milk products' may not be used for milk products other than those described in Article 2 thereof; whereas, as an exception, this principle is not applicable to the description of products the exact nature of which is known because of traditional use and/or when the designations are clearly used to describe a characteristic quality of the product;
Article 1 The products corresponding, on the territory of the Community, to the products referred to in the second subparagraph of Article 3 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 1898/87 are listed in the Annex hereto.

Whereas, in view of the experience gained, and account being taken of the current state of the art, it is now possible to make certain requirements of Directive 71/127/EEC more stringent in order to improve road safety;
Whereas the current requirements in respect of category N2 vehicles having a mass of more than 7,5 tonnes and category N3 vehicles other than tractive units for semi-trailers have proved to be inadequate in respect of the outside field of vision to the side and to the rear of the vehicle; whereas, in order to deal with this shortcoming, it is necessary to provide for the fitting of an additional rear-view mirror of the so-called 'wide-angle' type;
Whereas the current requirements in respect of category N2 vehicles having a mass of more than 7,5 tonnes have proved to be inadequate too with regard to the field of vision in the zone adjacent to the side of the cab structure opposite the driver; whereas, in order to deal with this shortcoming, it is necessary to provide for the fitting of a rear-view mirror of the 'close-proximity' type;
Whereas the measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee on the adaptation to technical progress of the Directives aimed at the removal of technical barriers to trade in the motor-vehicle sector,

WHEREAS IN ORDER TO ENSURE UNIFORM APPLICATION OF THE COMBINED NOMENCLATURE ANNEXED TO THE SAID REGULATION, IT IS NECESSARY TO ADOPT MEASURES CONCERNING THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE GOODS REFERRED TO IN THE ANNEX TO THIS REGULATION;
WHEREAS REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 2658/87 HAS SET DOWN THE GENERAL RULES FOR THE INTERPRETATION OF THE COMBINED NOMENCLATURE AND THESE RULES ALSO APPLY TO ANY OTHER NOMENCLATURE WHICH IS WHOLLY OR PARTLY BASED ON IT OR WHICH ADDS ANY ADDITIONAL SUBDIVISIONS TO IT AND WHICH IS ESTABLISHED BY SPECIFIC COMMUNITY PROVISIONS, WITH A VIEW TO THE APPLICATION OF TARIFF OR OTHER MEASURES RELATING TO TRADE IN GOODS;

ARTICLE 2
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 43 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2),
Whereas, pursuant to Article 1 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 2262/84 (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3462/87 (4), producer Member States must set up agencies for the purpose of carrying out certain checks and duties in connection with the olive oil production aid scheme; whereas, in accordance with Article 1 (5) of the said Regulation, the Council must adopt, before 1 January 1989, the method for financing the agencies' expenditure as from the 1989/90 marketing year;
Whereas, taking account of the important role that these bodies can play in ensuring that the production aid arrangements are applied correctly and in a uniform manner, provision should be made for a method of financing their actual expenditure which enables them to operate smoothly and efficiently within the framework of administrative autonomy provided for in the rules concerned; whereas that objective can be achieved via a method which combines Community financing and financing by the Member State;
Whereas the agencies in the four producer Member States concerned are not in an identical situation; whereas administrative and legal difficulties have resulted in delays in the setting-up and/or operation of the agencies in certain Member States; whereas those Member States did not make effective use of the maximum amounts which were earmarked for them during the initial phase when expenditure was fully chargeable to the Community; whereas the period covered by the said phase should therefore be extended by one year without increasing the maximum amounts already allocated under the existing rules,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
Article 1 (5) of Regulation (EEC) No 2262/84 is hereby replaced by the following:
'5. Over a period of five years from 1 November 1984, the following percentages of the agency's actual expenditure shall be chargeable to the general budget of the European Communities:
- in the case of Italy, 100 % for the first three years, up to a maximum of Ecu 14 million, and 50 % for the fourth and fifth years,
- in the case of Greece, 100 % up to a maximum of Ecu 7 million.
Over a period of three years from 1 November 1989, 50 % of the actual expenditure of the Italian and the Greek agencies shall be chargeable to the general budget of the European Communities.
In the case of Spain and Portugal, 100 % of the agency's actual expenditure during the period from 1 March 1986 to 31 October 1990 shall be covered by the general budget of the European Communities up to a maximum of Ecu 9 300 000 for Spain and Ecu 4 700 000 for Portugal. During the period from 1 November 1990 to 31 October 1992, 50 % of the expenditure in question shall be covered by the said budget.
Member States may, under conditions to be determined in accordance with the procedure provided for in Article 38 of Regulation No 136/66/EEC, cover part of the expenditure to be borne by them by a deduction from the Community aid granted for olive oil.
The Council, acting by qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, shall adopt by 1 January 1992 the method for financing the expenditure in question as from the 1992/93 marketing year.'
Article 2
This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
COUNCIL DIRECTIVE of 12 June 1989 on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health of workers at work (89/391/EEC)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 118a thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1), drawn up after consultation with the Advisory Committee on Safety, Hygiene and Health Protection at Work,
In cooperation with the European Parliament (2),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),
Whereas Article 118a of the Treaty provides that the Council shall adopt, by means of Directives, minimum requirements for encouraging improvements, especially in the working environment, to guarantee a better level of protection of the safety and health of workers;
Whereas, pursuant to Article 118a of the Treaty, such Directives must avoid imposing administrative, financial and legal constraints which would hold back the creation and development of small and medium-sized undertakings;
Whereas the communication from the Commission on its programme concerning safety, hygiene and health at work (4) provides for the adoption of Directives designed to guarantee the safety and health of workers;
Whereas the Council, in its resolution of 21 December 1987 on safety, hygiene and health at work (5), took note of the Commission's intention to submit to the Council in the near future a Directive on the organization of the safety and health of workers at the work place;
Whereas in February 1988 the European Parliament adopted four resolutions following the debate on the internal market and worker protection; whereas these resolutions specifically invited the Commission to draw up a framework Directive to serve as a basis for more specific Directives covering all the risks connected with safety and health at the work place;
Whereas Member States have a responsibility to encourage improvements in the safety and health of workers on their territory; whereas taking measures to protect the health and safety of workers at work also helps, in certain cases, to preserve the health and possibly the safety of persons residing with them;
Whereas Member States' legislative systems covering safety and health at the work place differ widely and need to be improved; whereas national provisions on the subject, which often include technical specifications and/or self-regulatory standards, may result in different levels of safety and health protection and allow competition at the expense of safety and health;
Whereas the incidence of accidents at work and occupational diseases is still too high; whereas preventive measures must be introduced or improved without delay in order to safeguard the safety and health of workers and ensure a higher degree of protection;
Whereas, in order to ensure an improved degree of protection, workers and/or their representatives must be informed of the risks to their safety and health and of the measures required to reduce or eliminate these risks; whereas they must also be in a position to contribute, by means of balanced participation in accordance with national laws and/or practices, to seeing that the necessary protective measures are taken;
Whereas information, dialogue and balanced participation on safety and health at work must be developed between employers and workers and/or their representatives by means of appropriate procedures and instruments, in accordance with national laws and/or practices;
Whereas the improvement of workers' safety, hygiene and health at work is an objective which should not be subordinated to purely economic considerations;
Whereas employers shall be obliged to keep themselves informed of the latest advances in technology and scientific findings concerning work-place design, account being taken of the inherent dangers in their undertaking, and to inform accordingly the workers' representatives exercising participation rights under this Directive, so as to be able to guarantee a better level of protection of workers' health and safety;
Whereas the provisions of this Directive apply, without prejudice to more stringent present or future Community provisions, to all risks, and in particular to those arising from the use at work of chemical, physical and biological agents covered by Directive 80/1107/EEC (6), as last amended by Directive 88/642/EEC (7);
Whereas a Committee composed of members nominated by the Member States needs to be set up to assist the Commission in making the technical adaptations to the individual Directives provided for in this Directive.
HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:
2. To that end it contains general principles concerning the prevention of occupational risks, the protection of safety and health, the elimination of risk and accident factors, the informing, consultation, balanced participation in accordance with national laws and/or practices and training of workers and their representatives, as well as general guidelines for the implementation of the said principles.
3. This Directive shall be without prejudice to existing or future national and Community provisions which are more favourable to protection of the safety and health of workers at work.
Article 2
Scope
1. This Directive shall apply to all sectors of activity, both public and private (industrial, agricultural, commercial, administrative, service, educational, cultural, leisure, etc.).
2. This Directive shall not be applicable where characteristics peculiar to certain specific public service activities, such as the armed forces or the police, or to certain specific activities in the civil protection services inevitably conflict with it.
In that event, the safety and health of workers must be ensured as far as possible in the light of the objectives of this Directive.

COUNCIL DIRECTIVE of 11 December 1989 concerning veterinary checks in intra-Community trade with a view to the completion of the internal market (89/662/EEC)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 43 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),
Whereas the Community is to adopt measures designed to establish the internal market progressively over a period expiring on 31 December 1992;
Whereas the harmonious operation of the common organization of the market in livestock products and products of animal origin implies the dismantling of veterinary barriers to the development of intra-Community trade in the products concerned; whereas in this respect the free movement of agricultural products is a fundamental feature of the common organization of markets and should facilitate the rational development of agricultural production and the optimum use of the factors of production.
Whereas in the veterinary field frontiers are currently being used for carrying out checks aimed at safeguarding public health and animal health;
Whereas the ultimate aim is to ensure that veterinary checks are carried out at the place of dispatch only; whereas the attainment of this objective implies the harmonization of the basic requirements relating to the safeguarding of public health and animal health;
Whereas with a view to the completion of the internal market, pending the attainment of this objective, the emphasis should be placed on the checks to be carried out at the place of dispatch and in organizing those that could be carried out at the place of destination; whereas such a solution would entail the suspension of veterinary checks at the Community's internal frontiers;
Whereas this solution implies increased confidence in the veterinary checks carried out by the State of dispatch; whereas the latter must ensure that such veterinary checks are carried out in an appropriate manner;
Whereas in the State of destination spot veterinary checks could be carried out at the place of destination; whereas, however, in the event of a serious presumption of irregularity, the veterinary check could be carried out while the goods are in transit;
Whereas it is for the Member States to specify in a plan to be submitted the manner in which they intend to carry out the checks and whereas these plans should be the subject of Community approval;
Whereas provision should be made for a procedure for resolving conflicts which could arise concerning consignments from an establishment, production centre or undertaking;
Whereas provision must be made for protective measures; whereas in this area, especially for reasons of effectiveness, responsibility must rest firstly with the Member State of dispatch; whereas the Commission must be able to act speedily, in particular by way of on-the-spot visits and adopting measures appropriate to the situation.
Whereas in order to be effective, the rules laid down by this Directive must cover all goods that are subject in the case of intra-Community trade to veterinary requirements;
Whereas, however, with regard to certain epizootic diseases, different health situations still prevail in the Member States and whereas, pending a Community approach on the methods to combat these diseases, the question of checking intra-Community trade in livestock should for the time being be left to one side and a documentary check should be permitted during transport; whereas, in view of the current state of harmonization and pending Community rules, goods that are not the subject of harmonized rules should comply with the requirements of the State of destination provided that the latter are in conformity with Article 36 of the Treaty;
Whereas the provisions of existing Directives should be adapted to the new rules laid down in this Directive;
Whereas these rules should be re-examined before the end of 1993;
Whereas the Commission should be entrusted with the task of adopting measures for applying this Directive; whereas, to that end, provision should be made for procedures establishing close and effective cooperation between the Commission and the Member States within the Standing Veterinary Committee,
HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:
Article 1
Member States shall ensure that the veterinary checks to be carried out on products of animal origin which are covered by the Directives listed in Annex A or by Article 14 and which are intended for trade are no longer carried out, without prejudice to Article 6, at frontiers but are carried out in accordance with this Directive.

The establishments of origin shall ensure, by constant self-supervision, that such products satisfy the requirements of the first subparagraph.
Without prejudice to the monitoring duties assigned to the official veterinarian under Community legislation, the competent authority shall carry out regular checks on establishments in order to satisfy itself that products intended for trade comply with Community requirements or, in the cases referred to in paragraph 3 of this Article and Article 14, with the requirements of the Member State of destination.
Where there are grounds for suspecting that requirements are not being met, the competent authority shall carry out the necessary checks and, if the suspicion is confirmed, take the appropriate measures, which may include withdrawing approval.
2. Where the transport operation involves several places of destination, products must be grouped together in as many batches as there are places of destination. Each batch must be accompanied by the aforementioned certificate or document.

(b) where the products referred to in Article 1 originating in another Member State are intended:
- for an establishment placed under the responsibility of an official veterinarian, the latter must ensure that only products that meet the requirements of Article 3 (1) with respect to marking and accompanying documents or, in the case of the products referred to in Annex B, are accompanied by the document stipulated by the rules of the country of destination, are admitted to that establishment,

The competent authority shall carry out random checks to verify compliance with those guarantees.
2. Without prejudice to Article 4, where the Community standards laid down by Community rules have not been set and in the case provided for in Article 14, the Member State of destination may require, with due regard for the general provisions of the Treaty, that the establishment of origin must apply the standards in force under the national rules of that Member State. The Member State of origin shall ensure that the product in question comply with those requirements.
3. Operators who have products delivered to them from another Member State or who completely divide up a batch of such products:
(a) shall be subject, if so requested by the competent authority, to prior registration;

(a) a documentary check is made on the products' origin;
(b) where products are imported from third countries, they must be sent, under customs supervision, to inspection posts in order that veterinary checks may be carried out.

- destroying the goods, or
- using the goods for other purposes, including returning them with the authorization of the competent authority of the country of the establishment of origin.
b) - However, if the certificate or the documents are found to contain irregularities, the consignor must be granted a period of grace before recourse is had to this last possibility.
2. In accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 18, the Commission shall draw up a list of the agents and diseases referred to in paragraph 1, and detailed rules for the application of this Article.
Article 8
1. In the cases provided for in Article 7, the competent authority of the Member State of destination shall contact the competent authorities of the Member State of dispatch without delay. The latter authorities shall take all necessary measures and notify the competent authority of the first Member State of the nature of the checks carried out, the decisions taken and the reasons for such decisions.
If the authority of the first Member State fears that such measures are inadequate, the competent authorities of the two Member States shall together seek ways and means of remedying the situation; if appropriate this may involve an on-the-spot inspection.
Where the checks provided for in Article 7 show repeated irregularities, the competent authority of the Member State of destination shall inform the Commission and the veterinary departments of the other Member States.
The Commission, at the request of the competent authority of the Member State of destination or on its own initiative, and taking into account the nature of the infringements established, may:

- instruct an official veterinarian, whose name shall be on a list to be prepared by the Commission at the suggestion of the Member States, and who is acceptable to the various parties concerned, to check the facts in the establishment concerned,
- request the competent authority to intensify its sampling of the products of the establishment concerned.
It shall inform the Member States of its findings.
Where these measures are taken to deal with repeated irregularities on the part of an establishment, the Commission shall charge any expenses occasioned by the application of the indents of the foregoing subparagraph to the establishment involved.

The Member State of destination may, for its part, intensify checks on products coming from the same establishment.
At the request of one of the two Member States concerned - where the irregularities are confirmed by the expert's opinion - the Commission must, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 17, take the appropriate measures, which may go as far as authorizing the Member States to prohibit provisionally the bringing into their territory of products coming from that establishment. These measures must be confirmed or reviewed as soon as possible in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 17.
The general rules for the application of this Article shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure set out in Article 18.
2. Rights of appeal existing under the laws in force in the Member States against decisions by the competent authorities shall not be affected by this Directive.
Decisions taken by the competent authority of the State of destination and the reasons for such decisions shall be notified to the consignor or his representative and to the competent authority of the Member State of dispatch.
If the consignor or his representative so requests, the said decisions and reasons shall be forwarded to him in writing with details of the rights of appeal which are available to him under the law in force in the Member State of destination and of the procedure and time limits applicable.
However, in the event of a dispute, and without prejudice to the aforementioned rights of appeal, the two parties concerned may, if they so agree, within a maximum period of one month, submit the dispute for the assessment of an expert whose name appears on a list of Community experts to be drawn up by the Commission; the cost of consulting the expert shall be borne by the Community.
Such experts shall issue their opinions within not more than 72 hours. The parties shall abide by the expert's opinion, with due regard for Community veterinary legislation.
3. The costs of returning the consignment, storing the goods, putting them to other uses or destroying them shall be borne by the consignee.
Article 9
The Member State of origin shall immediately implement the control or precautionary measures provided for in Community rules, in particular the determination of the buffer zones provided for in those rules, or adopt any other measure which it deems appropriate.
The Member State of destination or transit which, in the course of a check referred to in Article 5, has established the existence of one of the diseases or causes referred to in the first subparagraph may, if necessary, take the precautionary measures provided for in Community rules.
Pending the measures to be taken in accordance with paragraph 4, the Member State of destination may, on serious public or animal-health grounds, take interim protective measures with regard to the establishments concerned or, in the case of an epizootic disease, with regard to the area of protection provided for in Community rules.
The measures taken by Member States shall be notified to the Commission and to the other Member States without delay.

These measures shall be submitted to the Standing Veterinary Committee as soon as possible to be confirmed, amended or cancelled in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 17.
4. The Commission shall in all cases review the situation in the Standing Veterinary Committee at the earliest opportunity. It shall adopt the necessary measures for the products referred to in Article 1 and, if the situation so requires, for the originating products or products derived from those products in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 17. The Commission shall monitor the situation and, by the same procedure, shall amend or repeal the decisions taken, depending on how the situation develops.

COUNCIL DIRECTIVE of 21 December 1989 on the coordination of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to the application of review procedures to the award of public supply and public works contracts (89/665/EEC)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 100a thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),
In cooperation with the European Parliament (2),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),
Whereas Community Directives on public procurement, in particular Council Directive 71/305/EEC of 26 July 1971 concerning the coordination of procedures for the award of public works contracts (4), as last amended by Directive 89/440/EEC (5), and Council Directive 77/62/EEC of 21 December 1976 coordinating procedures for the award of public supply contracts (6), as last amended by Directive 88/295/EEC (7), do not contain any specific provisions ensuring their effective application;
Whereas the existing arrangements at both national and Community levels for ensuring their application are not always adequate to ensure compliance with the relevant Community provisions particularly at a stage when infringements can be corrected;
Whereas the opening-up of public procurement to Community competition necessitates a substantial increase in the guarantees of transparency and non-discrimination; whereas, for it to have tangible effects, effective and rapid remedies must be available in the case of infringements of Community law in the field of public procurement or national rules implementing that law;
Whereas, since procedures for the award of public contracts are of such short duration, competent review bodies must, among other things, be authorized to take interim measures aimed at suspending such a procedure or the implementation of any decisions which may be taken by the contracting authority; whereas the short duration of the procedures means that the aforementioned infringements need to be dealt with urgently;
Whereas it is necessary to ensure that adequate procedures exist in all the Member States to permit the setting aside of decisions taken unlawfully and compensation of persons harmed by an infringement;
Whereas, when undertakings do not seek review, certain infringements may not be corrected unless a specific mechanism is put in place;
Whereas, accordingly, the Commission, when it considers that a clear and manifest infringement has been committed during a contract award procedure, should be able to bring it to the attention of the competent authorities of the Member State and of the contracting authority concerned so that appropriate steps are taken for the rapid correction of any alleged infringement;
Whereas the application in practice of the provisions of this Directive should be re-examined within a period of four years of its implementation on the basis of information to be supplied by the Member States concerning the functioning of the national review procedures,
HAD ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:
Article 1
1. The Member States shall take the measures necessary to ensure that, as regards contract award procedures falling withing the scope of Directives 71/305/EEC and 77/62/EEC, decisions taken by the contracting authorities may be reviewed effectively and, in particular, as rapidly as possible in accordance with the conditions set out in the following Articles, and, in particular, Article 2 (7) on the grounds that such decisions have infringed Community law in the field of public procurement or national rules implementing that law.
2. Member States shall ensure that there is no discrimination between undertakings claiming injury in the context of a procedure for the award of a contract as a result of the distinction made by this Directive between national rules implementing Community law and other national rules.
3. The Member States shall ensure that the review procedures are available, under detailed rules which the Member States may establish, at least to any person having or having had an interest in obtaining a particular public supply or public works contract and who has been or risks being harmed by an alleged infringement. In particular, the Member States may require that the person seeking the review must have previously notified the contracting authority of the alleged infringement and of his intention to seek review.
Article 2
1. The Member States shall ensure that the measures taken concerning the review procedures specified in Article 1 include provision for the powers to:
(a) take, at the earliest opportunity and by way of interlocutory procedures, interim measures with the aim of correcting the alleged infringement or preventing further damage to the interests concerned, including measures to suspend or to ensure the suspension of the procedure for the award of a public contract or the implementation of any decision taken by the contracting authority;
(b) either set aside or ensure the setting aside of decisions taken unlawfully, including the removal of discriminatory technical, economic or financial specifications in the invitation to tender, the contract documents or in any other document relating to the contract award procedure;
(c) award damages to persons harmed by an infringement.
2. The powers specified in paragraph 1 may be conferred on separate bodies responsible for different aspects of the review procedure.
3. Review procedures need not in themselves have an automatic suspensive effect on the contract award procedures to which they relate.
5. The Member States may provide that where damages are claimed on the grounds that a decision was taken unlawfully, the contested decision must first be set aside by a body having the necessary powers.
6. The effects of the exercise of the powers referred to in paragraph 1 on a contract concluded subsequent to its award shall be determined by national law.
Furthermore, except where a decision must be set aside prior to the award of damages, a Member State may provide that, after the conclusion of a contract following its award, the powers of the body responsible for the review procedures shall be limited to awarding damages to any person harmed by an infringement.
7. The Member States shall ensure that decisions taken by bodies responsible for review procedures can be effectively enforced.
8. Where bodies responsible for review procedures are not judicial in character, written reasons for their decisions shall always be given. Furthermore, in such a case, provision must be made to guarantee procedures whereby any allegedly illegal measure taken by the review body or any alleged defect in the exercise of the powers conferred on it can be the subject of judicial review or review by another body which is a court or tribunal within the meaning of Article 177 of the EEC Treaty and independent of both the contracting authority and the review body.
The members of such an independent body shall be appointed and leave office under the same conditions as members of the judiciary as regards the authority responsible for their appointment, their period of office, and their removal. At least the President of this independent body shall have the same legal and professional qualifications as members of the judiciary. The independent body shall take its decisions following a procedure in which both sides are heard, and these decisions shall, by means determined by each Member State, be legally binding.
Article 3
1. The Commission may invoke the procedure for which this Article provides when, prior to a contract being concluded, it considers that a clear and manifest infringement of Community provisions in the field of public procurement has been committed during a contract award procedure falling within the scope of Directives 71/305/EEC and 77/62/EEC.
2. The Commission shall notify the Member State and the contracting authority concerned of the reasons which have led it to conclude that a clear and manifest infringement has been committed and request its correction.
3. Within 21 days of receipt of the notification referred to in paragraph 2, the Member State concerned shall communicate to the Commission:
(a) its confirmation that the infringement has been corrected; or
(b) a reasoned submission as to why no correction has been made; or
(c) a notice to the effect that the contract award procedure has been suspended either by the contracting authority on its own initiative or on the basis of the powers specified in Article 2 (1) (a).
4. A reasoned submission in accordance with paragraph 3 (b) may rely among other matters on the fact that the alleged infringement is already the subject of judicial or other review proceedings or of a review as referred to in Article 2 (8). In such a case, the Member State shall inform the Commission of the result of those proceedings as soon as it becomes known.
5. Where notice has been given that a contract award procedure has been suspended in accordance with paragraph 3 (c), the Member State shall notify the Commission when the suspension is lifted or another contract procedure relating in whole or in part to the same subject matter is begun. That notification shall confirm that the alleged infringement has been corrected or include a reasoned submission as to why no correction has been made.
Article 4
2. By 1 March each year the Member States shall communicate to the Commission information on the operation of their national review procedures during the preceding calendar year. The nature of the information shall be determined by the Commission in consultation with the Advisory Committee for Public Contracts.
Article 5
Member States shall bring into force, before 1 December 1991, the measures necessary to comply with this Directive. They shall communicate to the Commission the texts of the main national laws, regulations and administrative provisions which they adopt in the field governed by this Directive.
Article 6
This Directive is addressed to the Member States.
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the Common Customs Tariff (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 20/89 (2), and in particular Article 9 thereof,
Whereas in order to ensure uniform application of the combined nomenclature annexec to the said Regulation, it is necessary to adopt measures concerning the classification of the good referred to in the Annex to this Regulation;

Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 of 23 July 1987on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the Common Customs tariff (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 20/89 (2), and, in particular, its Article 9,
Whereas in order to ensure the uniform application of the combined nomenclature annexed to Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87, with regard to the tariff classification of anoraks (including ski-jackets), wind-cheaters, wind-jackets and similar articles falling within, amongst others, CN codes 6101, 6102, 6201 and 6202, it is necessary to specify certain characteristics of the said garments;
Whereas these articles fall in a category of garments generally worn over other clothing and they ensure a protection against the weather;
Whereas such protection cannot be ensured by garments without sleeves or with short sleeves; for this reason it is necessary to specify that the anoraks, wind-cheaters and similar articles mentioned above must have long sleeves;
Whereas the Nomenclature Committee has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its chairman,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1

Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),
Whereas the Annex to Regulation (Euratom) No 3954/87 (4) contains headings for the maximum permitted levels for foodstuffs and feedingstuffs;

Whereas the Commission submitted two communications to the Council on 14 June and 9 December 1988 respectively which were intended to supplement the Annex to the abovementioned Regulation and were drafted after consultation of the group of experts referred to in Article 31 of the Treaty;
Whereas the Annex to that Regulation should therefore be supplemented;
Whereas some other information in the said Annex should also be adapted in the light of the latest scientific work in the field;
Whereas it therefore seems advisable to consolidate the levels and the other information in the said Annex in a single table;
Whereas it also seems advisable, since further work is to be carried out, to stipulate that the procedure provided for in Article 7 of Regulation (Euratom) No 3954/87 should also apply for fixing the maximum permitted levels for feedingstuffs; whereas that Regulation should be supplemented accordingly,

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 100a thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),
In cooperation with the European Parliament (2),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),
Whereas measures should be adopted with the aim of progressively establishing the internal market over a period expiring on 31 December 1992; whereas the internal market comprises an area without internal frontiers on which the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital is ensured;
Whereas both pentachlorophenol (CAS No 87-86-5) and its compounds are substances that are dangerous to man and the environment, and in particular the aquatic environment; whereas the use of those substances should be regulated;
Whereas restrictions which have already been imposed by certain Member States on the use of marketing of the abovementioned substances or of preparations containing those substances directly affect the establishment and operation of the internal market; whereas it is therefore necessary to approximate the laws of the Member States in this field and, consequently, to amend Annex I to Directive 76/769/EEC (4), as last amended by Directive 89/678/EEC (5);

COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 92/32/EEC of 30 April 1992 amending for the seventh time Directive 67/548/EEC on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to the classification, packaging and labelling of dangerous substances
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 100a thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),
In cooperation with the European Parliament (2),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),
Whereas disparity between the laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to the classification, packaging and labelling of dangerous substances and to the notification of new substances in the Member States may lead to barriers to trade between Member States and create unequal conditions of competition; whereas the disparity between these measures in the Member States has a direct impact on the functioning of the internal market and does not guarantee the same level of protection of public health and the environment;
Whereas measures for the approximation of the provisions of the Member States which have as their object the establishment and functioning of the internal market shall, inasmuch as they concern health, safety and the protection of man and the environment, take as their basis a high level of protection;
Whereas, in order to protect man and the environment from potential risks which could arise from the placing on the market of new substances, it is necessary to lay down appropriate measures and in particular to amend and reinforce the provisions of Council Directive 67/548/ EEC (4), as last amended by Directive 90/517/EEC (5);
Whereas any new substance placed on the market should be notified to the competent authorities by means of a notification containing certain information; whereas, in the case of substances placed on the market in quantities of less than one tonne per year per manufacturer, the notification requirements may be reduced; whereas, however, where the quantity of a substance placed on the market exceeds certain limits, provision should be made for additional studies;
Whereas it is necessary to lay down measures to make it possible to introduce a notification procedure under which a notification made in one Member State is then valid for the Community; whereas it may be worthwhile, in the case of substances manufactured outside the Community, for the manufacturer to appoint an exclusive representative in the Community for the purpose of notification;
Whereas, in order to forecast the effects on man and the environment, it is advisible that any new substance that is notified be the subject of an assessment of the risks, and whereas uniform principles for risk assessment should be laid down;
Whereas it is, moreover, important to follow closely the evolution and use of new substances placed on the market and whereas it is therefore necessary to institute a system which allows all new substances to be listed;
Whereas the Commission, pursuant to Article 13 (1) of Directive 67/548/EEC (6), drew up, in accordance with the guidelines laid down in Commission Decision 81/437/EEC, an inventory of substances on the Community market as at 18 September 1981 (EINECS); whereas that inventory was published in the Official Journal of the European Communities (7);
Whereas it is appropriate to reduce to a minimum the number of animals used for experimental purposes, in accordance with Council Directive 86/609/EEC of 24 November 1986 on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States regarding the protection of animals used for experimental and other scientific purposes (8); whereas all appropriate measures should be taken to avoid the duplication of tests on animals;
Whereas Council Directive 87/18/EEC of 18 December 1986 on the harmonization of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to the application of the principles of good laboratory practice and the verification of their application for tests on chemical substances (9) specifies the Community principles of good laboratory practice which must be followed for tests on chemicals;
Whereas, in order to promote environmental protection and safety and health at work, it is desirable for safety data on dangerous substances to be available to professional users;
Whereas provisions should be adopted at Community level on the classification and labelling of substances in order to promote the protection of the population and, in particular, of the workers who use them;
Whereas, in order to ensure an adequate level of protection for man and the environment, it is necessary to introduce measures for the packaging and provisional labelling of dangerous substances not appearing in Annex I to Directive 67/548/EEC; whereas, for the same reason, it is necessary to make the indication of safety advice mandatory;

Article 3
Testing and assessment of the properties of substances
1. Tests on chemicals carried out within the framework of this Directive shall as a general principle be conducted according to the methods laid down in Annex V. The physico-chemical properties of substances shall be determined according to the methods specified in Annex V. A; their toxicity shall be determined according to the methods specified in Annex V. B and their ecotoxicity according to the methods specified in Annex V. C.
However, for some of the substances on the EINECS it is possible that test data exist which have been generated by methods other than those laid down in Annex V. The adequacy of such data for the purposes of classification and labelling and the need to conduct new tests according to Annex V must be decided on a case-by-case basis taking into account among other factors the need to minimize testing on vertebrate animals.
Laboratory tests shall be carried out in compliance with the principles of good laboratory practice provided for in Directive 87/18/EEC and with the provisions of Directive 86/609/EEC.
2. The real or potential risk to man and the environment shall be assessed on the basis of the principles adopted, by 30 April 1993, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 29 (4) (b). These principles shall be regularly reviewed and, where appropriate, revised in accordance with the same procedure.
Article 4
Classification
1. Substances shall be classified on the basis of their intrinsic properties according to the categories laid down in Aricle 2 (2). In the classification of substances, impurities shall be taken into account as far as the concentration(s) of the latter exceed the concentration limits specified in paragraph 4 of this Article and in Article 3 of Directive 88/379/EEC.
2. The general principles of the classification and labelling of substances and preparations shall be applied according to the criteria in Annex VI (24), save where contrary requirements for dangerous preparations are specified in separate Directives.
3. Annex I (25) contains the list of substances classified in accordance with the principles outlined in paragraphs 1 and 2, together with their harmonized classification and labelling. The decision to place a substance in Annex I together with the harmonized classification and labelling shall be taken in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 29.

1. Any notifier of a substance already notified in conformity with Articles 7 (1) or 8 (1) shall be responsible on his own initiative for informing in writing the competent authority to which the initial notification was submitted of:
- changes in the annual or total quantities placed on the Community market by him or, in the case of a substance manufactured outside the Community for which the notifier has been designated as sole representative, by him and/or others,
- new knowledge of the effects of the substance on man and/or the environment of which he may reasonably be expected to have become aware,
- new uses for which the substance is placed on the market of which he may reasonably be expected to have become aware,
- any change in the composition of the substances as given in Annex VII. A, B or C, section 1.3,
- any change in his status (manufacturer or importer).
2. Any importer of a substance produced by a manufacturer established outside the Community who imports the substance within the framework of a notification previously submitted by a sole representative in accordance with Article 2 (1) (d) shall be required to ensure that the sole representative is provided with up-to-date information concerning the quantities of the substance introduced by him on to the Community market.
Article 15
Renotification of the same substance and avoidance of duplicating testing on vertebrate animals
1. In the case of a substance which has already been notified in accordance with Articles 7 (1) or 8 (1), the competent authority may agree that the subsequent notifier of that substance may, for the purposes of sections 3, 4 and 5 of Annex VII. A and B and sections 3 and 4 of Annex VIII. C, refer to the results of the tests/studies forwarded by the first notifier, in so far as the subsequent notifier can provide evidence that the substance renotified is the same as the one previously notified, including the degree of purity and the nature of impurities. The first notifier must give his agreement in writing to the reference to the results of the tests/studies he has forwarded before such reference can be made.
2. Before carrying out testing on vertebrate animals for the purpose of submitting a notification in conformity with Articles 7 (1) or 8 (1), and without prejudice to paragraph 1, prospective notifiers shall enquire of the competent authorities of the Member State within which they intend subsequently to notify; as to:
(a) whether or not the substance they intend to notify has already been notified; and
(b) the name and address of the first notifier.
(a) the competent authority receiving the enquiry is satisfied that the prospective notifier intends to place the substance on the market in the quantities stated; and
(b) the substance has been notified previously; and
(c) the first notifier has not requested and been granted a temporary exemption from the provisions of this Article,
The first notifier and the prospective notifier shall take all reasonable steps to reach an agreement on the sharing of information so as to avoid the duplication of testing on vertebrate animals.
3. Notifiers of the same substance who have agreed to share information relating to Annex VII in accordance with paragraphs 1 and 2 shall also take all necessary steps to reach an agreement on the sharing of information derived from testing on vertebrate animals submitted in conformity with Article 7 (2).
4. If, despite the provisions of paragraphs 2 and 3, notifiers and prospective notifiers of the same substance can still not reach an agreement on the sharing of data, Member States may, for notifiers and prospective notifiers located within their territory, introduce national measures obliging notifiers and prospective notifiers to share the data with a view to avoiding duplicative testing on vertebrate animals and determine both the procedure for utilizing information, including regulations on the temporary exemption referred to in the final indent of Article 7 (1) and the reasonable balance of the interests of the parties concerned.
Article 16
Rights and duties of the authorities
1. Member States shall appoint the competent authority or authorities responsible for receiving the information provided for in Articles 7 to 14 and examining its conformity with the requirements of this Directive.
Moreover, if it can be shown to be necessary for the evaluation of the risk which may be caused by a substance, the competent authorities may ask for further information, verification and/or confirmatory tests concerning the substances or their transformation products, of which they have been notified or have received information under this Directive; this may also include requesting any of the information referred to in Annex VIII earlier than provided for in Article 7 (2).
Additionally, the competent authorities may:
- carry out such sampling as is necessary for control purposes,
- require the notifier to supply such quantities of the notified substance as it deems necessary for the carrying out of verification tests,
- take appropriate measures relating to safe use of a substance pending the introduction of Community provisions.
In the case of substances notified in accordance with Articles 7 (1) and 8 (1) and (2), the competent authority which received notification shall carry out an assessment of the risks in accordance with the general principles laid down in Article 3 (2). The assessment shall include recommendations on the most appropriate method for testing the substance and, where appropriate, also include recommendations on measures which will enable the risk for man and the environment in connection with the marketing of the substance to be lessened. The assessment shall be updated from time to time in the light of additional information provided under this Article or Articles 7 (2), 8 (3) and 14 (1).
2. In the case of notifications submitted in conformity with Article 7, within a period of 60 days following receipt of the notification, the authority shall inform the notifier in writing as to whether the notification has, or has not, been accepted as being in conformity with this Directive.
If the dossier is accepted, the authority shall at the same time advise the notifier of the official number which has been allocated to the notification. If the dossier is not accepted, the authority shall inform the notifier as to what further information he is required to provide in order to bring the dossier into conformity with this Directive.
3. For notifications submitted in accordance with Article 8, the competent authority shall, within a period of 30 days following receipt of the notification, decide whether the notification is in conformity with this Directive and, where the notification is adjudged not to be in conformity, inform the notifier as to what further information he is required to provide in order to bring the dossier into conformity with the Directive. Where the notification is in conformity with the Directive, the authority shall, within the same period, advise the notifier of the official number which has been allocated to his notification.
4. For substances manufactured outside the Community for which more than one notification has been submitted for the substance produced by one manufacturer, the competent authorities, together with the Commission, shall be responsible for calculating the annual and cumulative tonnages placed upon the Community market. If the tonnage thresholds detailed in Article 7 (2) are attained, the competent authority responsible for receiving the notification(s) shall contact each notifier informing them of the identity of the other notifiers and drawing their attention to their collective responsibility as outlined in Article 11.
5. The procedure laid down in Article 28 shall be followed confirming or amending proposals for classification and labelling.
6. Without prejudice to Article 19 (1), Member States and the Commission shall ensure that any information concerning commercial exploitation or manufacturing is kept secret.
Article 17
Involvement of the Commission in the notification procedure
When a Member State has received the notification dossier referred to in Articles 7 (1) and 8 (1), or information on the supplementary testing carried out in accordance with Articles 7 (2) and 8 (3), or follow-up information submitted in conformity with Article 14, it shall as soon as possible send the Commission a copy of the dossier or of the further information or a summary thereof.
In the case of the further information referred to in Article 16 (1), the competent authority shall notify the Commission of the tests chosen, the reasons for their choice, the results and, if appropriate, an assessment of the results. In the case of information received in conformity with Article 13 (2), the competent authority shall forward to the Commission such elements as would be of common interest for the Commission and the other competent authorities.
The assessment of the risks referred to in Article 16 (1) or a summary of that assessment shall be forwarded to the Commission as soon as it becomes available.
Article 18
Duties of the Commission
1. On receipt of the dossiers and information referred to in Article 17, the Commission shall forward copies to the Member States. In addition, the Commission may also forward any other relevant information it has collected pursuant to this Directive, as it sees fit.
2. The competent authority of any Member State may consult directly the competent authority which received the original notification, or the Commission, on specific details of the data contained in the dossier required under this Directive or the assessment of the risks provided for in Article 16 (1); it may also suggest that further tests or information be requested or that the assessment of the risks be modified. If the competent authority which received the original notification fails to comply with the suggestions of other authorities regarding further information, confirmation tests or amendments in the study programmes provided for in Annex VIII or the assessment of the risks, it shall give its reasons to the other authorities concerned. Should it not be possible for the authorities concerned to reach agreement and should any one authority feel, on the basis of detailed reasons, that additional information, confirmation tests or amendments in the study programmes or an assessment are nevertheless really necessary to protect man and the environment, it may ask the Commission to take a decision in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 29 (4) (b).
Article 19
Confidentiality of data
1. If he considers that there is a confidentiality problem, the notifier may indicate the information provided for in Articles 7, 8 and 14 which he considers to be commercially sensitive and disclosure of which might harm him industrially or commercially, and which he therefore wishes to be kept secret from all persons other than the competent authorities and the Commission. Full justification must be given in such cases.
With respect to the notifications and information submitted in conformity with Articles 7 (1) and (2), 8 (1), (2) and (3), industrial and commercial secrecy shall not apply to:
(a) the trade name of the substance;
(b) the name of the manufacturer and the notifier;
(c) physico-chemical data concerning the substance in connection with section 3 of Annexes VII. A, VII. B and VII. C;
(d) the possible ways of rendering the substance harmless;
(e) the summary results of the toxicological and ecotoxicological tests;
(h) the information contained in the safety data sheet;

If the notifier, manufacturer or importer should himself later disclose previously confidential information, he shall inform the competent authority accordingly.
2. The authority receiving the notification/ information shall decide on its own responsibility which information is covered by industrial and commercial secrecy in accordance with paragraph 1.
Information accepted as being confidential by the authority receiving the notification dossier from the notifier shall be treated as being confidential by the other competent authorities and the Commission.

For substances appearing in the list provided for in Article 21 (1) and which are not classified as dangerous within the meaning of this Directive, the name may be included in the form of its trade name in those cases where the competent authority to which the notification has been submitted so requests. Normally, such substances may be included in the list in the form of their trade name for a maximum of three years. However, if the competent authority to which the dossier was submitted considers that the publication of the chemical name in the IUPAC nomenclature itself could reveal information concerning commercial exploitation or manufacture, the name of the substance may be recorded under its trade name alone for as long as that competent authority sees fit.
Dangerous substances may, at the request of the competent authority receiving the notification, be entered on the list in the form of their trade names alone until such time as they are introduced into Annex I.
4. Confidential information brought to the attention either of the Commission or of a Member State shall be kept secret.
In all cases such information:
- may be brought to the attention only of the authorities whose responsibilities are specified in Article 16 (1),

COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 92/77/EEC of 19 October 1992 supplementing the common system of value added tax and amending Directive 77/388/EEC (approximation of VAT rates)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 99 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),
Whereas completing the internal market, which is one of the fundamental objectives of the Community, requires as a first step that fiscal controls at the frontiers be abolished;
Whereas, if distortions are to be avoided, such abolition implies in the case of value added tax, not only a uniform tax base but also a number of rates and rate levels which are sufficiently close as between Member States; whereas it is therefore necessary to amend Directive 77/388/EEC (4);
Whereas, during the transitional period, certain derogations concerning number and level of rates should be possible,
HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:
Article 1
Directive 77/388/EEC is hereby amended as follows:
1. Article 12 (3) is replaced by the following:
'3. (a) From 1 January 1993 Member States shall apply a standard rate which, until 31 December 1996, may not be less than 15 %.
On the basis of the report on the operation of the transitional arrangements and proposals on the definitive arrangements to be submitted by the Commission pursuant to Article 281 the Council shall decide unanimously before 31 December 1995 on the level of the minimum rate to be applied after 31 December 1996 with regard to the standard rate.
Member States may also apply either one or two reduced rates. The reduced rates may not be less than 5 % and shall only apply to supplies of the categories of goods and services specified in Annex H.
(b) Member States may apply a reduced rate to supplies of natural gas and electricity provided that no risk of distortion of competition exists. A Member State intending to apply such a rate must, before doing so, inform the Commission. The Commission shall give a decision on the existence of a risk of distortion of competition. If the Commission has not taken that decision within three months of the receipt of the information a risk of distortion of competition is deemed not to exist.
(c) The rules concerning the rates applied to works of art, antiques and collector's items, shall be determined by the directive relating to the special arrangements applicable to second-hand goods, works of art, antiques and collector's items. The Council shall adopt this Directive before 31 December 1992.
(d) The rules concerning the taxation of agricultural outputs other than those falling within category 1 of Annex H shall be decided unanimously by the Council before 31 December 1994 on the basis of a Commission proposal.
Until 31 December 1994, those Member States currently applying a reduced rate may continue to do so; those currently applying a standard rate may not apply a reduced rate. This will allow a two-year postponement of the application of the standard rate.
(e) The rules concerning the regime and the rates applied to gold shall be determined by a directive relating to special arrangements applicable to gold. The Commission shall make such a proposal in time for its adoption by the Council, acting unanimously, before 31 December 1992.
Member States will take all necessary measures to combat fraud in this area from 1 January 1993. These measures may include the introduction of a system of accounting for VAT on supplies of gold between taxable persons in the same Member State which provides for the payment of tax by the buyer on behalf of the seller and a simultaneous right for the buyer to a deduction of the same amount of tax as input tax.';
2. the first sentence of Article 12 (4) shall be deleted;
3. the following subparagraph is added to Article 12 (4):
'On the basis of a report from the Commission, the Council shall, starting in 1994, review the scope of the reduced rates every two years. The Council, acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission, may decide to alter the list of goods and services in Annex H.';
4. Article 28 (2) is replaced by the following:
'2. Notwithstanding Article 12 (3), the following provisions shall apply during the transitional period referred to in Article 281.
(a) Exemptions with refund of the tax paid at the preceding stage and reduced rates lower than the minimum rate laid down in Article 12 (3) in respect of the reduced rates, which were in force on 1 January 1991 and which are in accordance with Community law, and satisfy the conditions stated in the last indent of Article 17 of the second Council Directive of 11 April 1967, may be maintained.
Member States shall adopt the measures necessary to ensure the determination of own resources relating to these operations.
In the event that the provisions of this paragraph create for Ireland distortions of competition in the supply of energy products for heating and lighting, Ireland may, on specific request, be authorized by the Commission to apply a reduced rate to such supplies, in accordance with Article 12 (3). In that case, Ireland shall submit its request to the Commission together with all necessary information. If the Commission has not taken a decision within three months of receiving the request, Ireland shall be deemed to be authorized to apply the proposed reduced rates.
(b) Member States which, at 1 January 1991 in accordance with Community law, applied exemptions with refund of tax paid at the preceding stage, or reduced rates lower than the minimum laid down in Article 12 (3) in respect of the reduced rates, to goods and services other than those specified in Annex H, may apply the reduced rate or one of the two reduced rates provided for in Article 12 (3) to any such supplies.
(c) Member States which under the terms of Article 12 (3) will be obliged to increase their standard rate as applied at 1 January 1991 by more than 2 %, may apply a reduced rate lower than the minimum laid down in Article 12 (3) in respect of the reduced rate to supplies of categories of goods and services specified in Annex H. Furthermore, those Member States may apply such a rate to restaurant services, children's clothing, children's footwear and housing. Member States may not introduce exemptions with refund of the tax at the preceding stage on the bais of this paragraph.
(d) Member States which at 1 January 1991 applied a reduced rate to restaurant services, children's clothing, children's footwear and housing, may continue to apply such a rate to such supplies.
(e) Member States which at 1 January 1991 applied a reduced rate to supplies of goods and services other than those specified in Annex H may apply the reduced rate or one of the two reduced rates provided for in Article 12 (3) to such supplies, provided that the rate is not lower than 12 %.
(f) The Hellenic Republic may apply VAT rates up to 30 % lower than the corresponding rates applied in mainland Greece in the departments of Lesbos, Chios, Samos, the Dodecanese and the Cyclades, and on the following islands in the Aegean: Thasos, Northern Sporades, Samothrace and Skiros.
(g) On the basis of a report from the Commission, the Council shall, before 31 December 1994, reexamine the provisions of subparagraphs (a) to (f) above in relation to the proper functioning of the internal market in particular. In the event of significant distortions of competition arising, the Council, acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission, shall adopt appropriate measures.';

Whereas, in order to do this, it is necessary to amend the arrangements for imports into the Community under the provisions of the Protocols to the Association or Cooperation Agreements with Algeria, Cyprus, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Malta, Moroco, Syria and Tunisia,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
1. The customs duties applicable on 31 December 1991 in the Community as constituted on 31 December 1985 to products listed in Annex II to the Treaty, which originate in the Mediterranean non-member countries in question and for which tariff dismantling is to extend beyond 1 January 1993 pursuant to the Protocols to the Association or Cooperation Agreements shown in Annex I hereto, shall be abolished in two equal stages, from 1 January 1992 and from 1 January 1993.
2. Paragraph 1 shall apply within the limits, if any, of the tariff quotas and timetables laid down in the Protocols referred to in that paragraph and shall take account of any special provisions laid down therein.
3. When, as a result of the application of paragraph 1, customs duties reach a level of 2 % or less, they shall be suspended in full.
COUNCIL REGULATION (EEC) No 2077/92 of 30 June 1992 concerning inter-branch organizations and agreements in the tobacco sector
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Articles 42 and 43 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),
Whereas the medium and long-term prospects for the Community and world agricultural markets require certain instruments of the common agricultural policy to be revised in order to restore market balance; whereas such adjustments, directed principally at increasing the flexibility of the market-support instruments, require the operators concerned to change their economic behaviour to take better account of the actual market situation;
Whereas inter-branch organizations established by individuals or groups, and representing a significant proportion of the various categories involved in production, processing and marketing in the tobacco sector are likely to contribute to better account being taken of the market situation and encourage changes in economic behaviour intended to improve knowledge and organization of production, processing and marketing; whereas some of their activities may contribute to improving market balance and so help achieve the objectives in Article 39 of the Treaty; whereas the measures which may constitute such a contribution by the inter-branch organizations should be defined;
Whereas in view of the above, it appears appropriate to grant specific recognition to bodies which can demonstrate their proven representativeness at regional, inter-regional or Community level and which take positive action in pursuit of the objectives mentioned above; whereas such recognition should be granted by the Member State or by the Commission depending on the scope of the activities of the trade association;
Whereas to support certain activities of inter-branch organizations which are of particular interest in the light of the current rules concerning the market organization for the tobacco sector, provision should be made for the rules adopted by an inter-branch organization for its members to be extended, subject to certain conditions, to all non-member producers and groups in one or more regions; whereas non-members should also be made liable to pay all or part of the subscriptions intended to cover the non-administrative costs incurred in pursuing such activities; whereas this procedure should be implemented in a way which guarantees the rights of the socio-economic groups concerned, in particular the rights of the consumer;
Whereas other activities of the recognized inter-branch organizations may be of general economic or technical interest for the tobacco sector and so be of benefit to all persons active in the branches in question, whether or not they are members of the organization; whereas in such cases it appears reasonable to make non-members liable to pay the subscriptions intended to cover the costs, other than administrative costs, arising directly from performance of the activities in question;
Whereas, in order to ensure correct operation of the scheme, there should be close cooperation between the Member States and the Commission, which should also have permanent monitoring powers, particularly as regards recognition of inter-branch organizations operating at regional or inter-regional level and the agreements and concerted practices adopted by such organizations;
Whereas there should be provision for publication, at the beginning of each year, of a list of the organizations recognized during the previous year, a list of the organizations whose recognition has been withdrawn during the same period and the rules which have been extended with an indication of their scope, for the information of the Member States and other interested parties,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
3. are pursuing a number of the following activities at regional level, in a number of Community regions or throughout the Community; taking account where appropriate of consumer interests:
(a) contributing to enhanced coordination of the placing on the market of leaf or baled tobacco;
(b) preparing standard contracts compatible with Community rules;
(c) improving market intelligence and transparency;
(d) increasing value added, particularly by means of marketing and research into new uses which do not pose a threat to public health;
(e) redirecting the sector towards products which better meet market and public health requirements;
(f) carrying out research into methods permitting reduced use of plant health products and guaranteeing product quality and soil conservation;
(g) developing methods and instruments for improving product quality at the production and processing stages;
2. Prior to recognition being granted, Member States shall notify the Commission of the inter-branch organizations which have applied for recognition and provide all necessary information on the branches of economic activity which they encompass, their representativeness, the activities undertaken and any other information required for consideration of the application.
The Commission may oppose recognition within 60 days of notification by the Member State.
3. Member States shall withdraw recognition:
(a) if the conditions laid down in this Regulation cease to be met;
(b) if the inter-branch organization contravenes one or more of the prohibitions listed in Article 7 (3), without prejudice to criminal proceedings which may be brought under national law;
(c) if the inter-branch organization fails in its obligation to make the notification required under Article 7 (2).
Member States shall notify the Commission immediately of decisions to withdraw recognition.
Article 4
1. On application the Commission shall recognize inter-branch organizations which:
(a) carry out their activities throughout or in part of the territories of several Member States, or throughout the Community;
(b) have been established under the national legislation of a Member State or under Community law;
(c) satisfy the provisions of Article 3 (1) (b), (c) and (d).
2. The Commission shall notify applications for recognition to the Member States on whose territories the inter-branch organization is established and in which it carries out its activities. Following such notification, the Member States concerned shall have two months within which to make their comments.
The Commission shall take a decision on recognition within three months of receiving the application and all necessary information.
3. The Commission shall withdraw recognition of the organizations referred to in paragraph 1 in the circumstances referred to in Article 3 (3).
Article 5
The Commission shall publish in the 'C' series of the Official Journal of the European Communities the names of the inter-branch organizations recognized, together with a statement of the economic sector or the area in which they operate and the activities pursued within the meaning of Article 2. Withdrawals of recognition shall also be published.
Article 6
Recognition of inter-branch organizations shall imply authorization for them to carry out the activities referred to in Article 2 (3) subject to the conditions laid down in this Regulation.
Article 7
1. Notwithstanding Article 1 of Regulation No 26 (4), Article 85 (1) of the Treaty shall not apply to the agreements and concerted practices of recognized inter-branch organizations intended to implement the measures referred to in Article 2 (3).
2. Paragraph 1 shall apply only provided that:
- the agreements and concerted practices have been notified to the Commission, and that
- within three months of receipt of all the details required the Commission has not found that the agreements or concerted practices are incompatible with Community rules.
The agreements and concerted practices may not be implemented until this period has elapsed.
3. Agreements and concerted practices which:
- may lead to the partitioning of markets in any form within the Community,
- may affect the sound operation of the market organization,
- may create distortions of competition which are not essential in achieving the objectives of the common agricultural policy pursued by the inter-branch organization measure,
- entail the fixing of prices or quotas, without prejudice to measures taken by inter-branch organizations in the application of specific provisions of Community rules,
- may create discrimination or eliminate competition in respect of a substantial proportion of the products in question,
That decision shall not come into effect earlier than the date of notification to the inter-branch organization concerned, unless that inter-branch organization has given incorrect information or abused the exemption provided for in paragraph 1.
Article 8
1. Inter-branch organizations may request that certain of their agreements or concerted practices be made binding for a limited period on individuals and groups in the economic sector concerned which are not members of the trade branches which they represent, in the areas in which the branches operate.
In order for their rules to be extended, inter-branch organizations must represent at least two thirds of the production and/or the trade concerned. Where the proposed extension of the rules is of inter-regional scope, the inter-branch organizations must prove they possess a minimum degree of representativeness, in respect of each of the grouped branches, in each region covered.
2. The rules, of which extension of the scope is requested, shall have been in force for at least one year and shall relate to one of the following objectives:
(a) knowledge of production and the market;
(b) definition of minimum quantities;
(c) the utilization of cultivation methods compatible with the protection of the environment;
(d) the definition of minimum standards of packing and presentation;
(e) use of certified seed and monitoring of product quality.
3. Extension of the rules shall be subject to approval by the Commission in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 9.
Article 9

In the case of rules laid down by inter-branch organizations recognized by the Member States, the Member States shall publish for the information of the socio-economic groups concerned the agreements or concerted practices which it is intended to extend to non-member individual operators or groups in a particular region or group of regions.
Those concerned shall have two months in which to make their comments.
2. At the end of this period and prior to taking a decision, the Member States shall notify the Commission of the rules which they intend to make binding and supply all appropriate information. Notification shall include all the comments received following publication in accordance with paragraph 1 and an evaluation of the application for extension.
3. The Commission shall publish in the 'C' series of the Official Journal of the European Communities rules of which extension is requested by inter-branch organizations which it has recognized under Article 4. Following publication, the Member States and the socio-economic groups concerned shall have two months in which to make their comments.
4. If the rules of which extension is requested are 'technical rules' within the meaning of Directive 83/189/EEC (5), they shall be notified to the Commission in accordance with Article 8 of that Directive at the same time as the notification provided for in paragraph 2.
Without prejudice to paragraph 5, where the conditions for delivery of a reasoned opinion under Article 9 of that Directive are met, the Commission shall refuse to approve the rules of which extension has been requested.
5. The Commission shall take a decision within three months of notification by the Member State in accordance with paragraph 2 and, where paragraph 3 applies, within five months of publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities of the application for extension of rules.
The Commission shall in any case take a negative decision if it finds that the extension:
- prevents competition in a substantial part of the common market,
- restricts freedom of trade, or
- jeopardizes the objectives of the common agricultural policy or those of any other Community rules.
6. The rules, application of which has been extended, shall be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
7. When, pursuant to this Article, rules are made binding on non-members of an inter-branch organization, the Member State or the Commission, as appropriate, may decide that individuals or groups which are not members shall pay the organization all or part of the subscriptions paid by members, to the extent that such subscriptions are not used to cover the administrative costs of applying the rules or concerted practices.
Article 10
1. Where one or more of the activities referred to in paragraph 2 are pursued by a recognized inter-branch organization and are in the general economic interest of those persons whose activities relate to one or more of the products, the Member State which has granted recognition, or the Commission, where recognition has been granted under Article 4, may decide that individuals or groups which are not members of the association but which benefit from those activities shall pay the organization all or part of the subscriptions paid by its members to the extent that such subscriptions are intended to cover costs, other than administrative costs of any description, directly incurred as a result of pursuing the activities in question.
2. The activities referred to in this Article shall relate to one or other of the following objectives:
- research to add value to the products, in particular through new uses which do not pose a threat to public health,
- studies to improve the quality of leaf or baled tobacco,
- research into methods of cultivation permitting reduced use of plant health products and guaranteeing conservation of the soil and the environment.
3. The Member States concerned shall notify the Commission of decisions which they intend to take under paragraph 1. Such decisions may not take effect until three months have elapsed from the date of notification to the Commission. The Commission may within this time limit call for the rejection of all or part of the draft decision if the general economic interest put forward does not appear to be well founded.
4. Where the activities of an inter-branch organization recognized by the Commission pursuant to Article 4 are in the general economic interest, the Commission shall notify its draft decision to the Member States concerned, who shall then have two months in which to make their comments.
Article 11
Any measure by the Member States or the Commission imposing a subscription on individuals or groups which are not members of an inter-branch organization shall be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities. The measure may not take effect until two months have elapsed from the date of publication.
Article 12
Detailed rules for the application of this Regulation shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 23 of Regulation (EEC) No 2075/92 (6).
This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.
COUNCIL REGULATION (EEC) No 2081/92 of 14 July 1992 on the protection of geographical indications and designations of origin for agricultural products and foodstuffs
Whereas, as part of the adjustment of the common agricultural policy the diversification of agricultural production should be encouraged so as to achieve a better balance between supply and demand on the markets; whereas the promotion of products having certain characteristics could be of considerable benefit to the rural economy, in particular to less-favoured or remote areas, by improving the incomes of farmers and by retaining the rural population in these areas;
Whereas, moreover, it has been observed in recent years that consumers are tending to attach greater importance to the quality of foodstuffs rather than to quantity; whereas this quest for specific products generates a growing demand for agricultural products or foodstuffs with an identifiable geographical origin;
Whereas in view of the wide variety of products marketed and of the abundance of information concerning them provided, consumers must, in order to be able to make the best choice, be given clear and succinct information regarding the origin of the product;
Whereas the labelling of agricultural products and foodstuffs is subject to the general rules laid down in Council Directive 79/112/EEC of 18 December 1978 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs (4); whereas, in view of their specific nature, additional special provisions should be adopted for agricultural products and foodstuffs from a specified geographical area;
Whereas the desire to protect agricultural products or foodstuffs which have an identifiable geographical origin has led certain Member States to introduce 'registered designations of origin`; whereas these have proved successful with producers, who have secured higher incomes in return for a genuine effort to improve quality, and with consumers, who can purchase high quality products with guarantees as to the method of production and origin;
Whereas, however, there is diversity in the national practices for implementing registered designations or origin and geographical indications; whereas a Community approach should be envisaged; whereas a framework of Community rules on protection will permit the development of geographical indications and designations of origin since, by providing a more uniform approach, such a framework will ensure fair competition between the producers of products bearing such indications and enchance the credibility of the products in the consumers' eyes;
Whereas the planned rules should take account of existing Community legislation on wines and spirit drinks, which provide for a higher level of protection;
Whereas the scope of this Regulation is limited to certain agricultural products and foodstuffs for which a link between product or foodstuff characteristics and geographical origin exists; whereas, however, this scope could be enlarged to encompass other products or foodstuffs;
Whereas existing practices make it appropriate to define two different types of geographical description, namely protected geographical indications and protected designations of origin;
Whereas an agricultural product or foodstuff bearing such an indication must meet certain conditions set out in a specification;
Whereas to enjoy protection in every Member State geographical indications and designations of origin must be registered at Community level; whereas entry in a register should also provide information to those involved in trade and to consumers;
Whereas the registration procedure should enable any person individually and directly concerned in a Member State to exercise his rights by notifying the Commission of his opposition;
Whereas there should be procedures to permit amendment of the specification, after registration, in the light of technological progress or withdrawal from the register of the geographical indication or designation of origin of an agricultural product or foodstuff if that product or foodstuff ceases to conform to the specification on the basis of which the geographical indication or designation of origin was granted;
Whereas provision should be made for trade with third countries offering equivalent guarantees for the issue and inspection of geographical indications or designations of origin granted on their territory;
Whereas provision should be made for a procedure establishing close cooperation between the Member States and the Commission through a Regulatory Committee set up for that purpose,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
1. This Regulation lays down rules on the protection of designations of origin and geographical indications of agricultural products intended for human consumption referred to in Annex II to the Treaty and of the foodstuffs referred to in Annex I to this Regulation and agricultural products listed in Annex II to this Regulation.
However, this Regulation shall not apply to wine products or to spirit drinks.
Annex I may be amended in accordance with the procedure set out in Article 15.
2. This Regulation shall apply without prejudice to other specific Community provisions.
3. Council Directive 83/189/EEC of 28 March 1983 laying down a procedure for the provision of information in the field of technical standards and regulations (5) shall not apply to the designations of origin and geographical indications covered by this Regulation.
- originating in that region, specific place or country, and
- the quality or characteristics of which are essentially or exclusively due to a particular geographical environment with its inherent natural and human factors, and the production, processing and preparation of which take place in the defined geographical area;
(b) geographical indication: means the name of a region, a specific place or, in exceptional cases, a country, used to describe an agricultural product or a foodstuff:
- originating in that region, specific place or country, and
- which possesses a specific quality, reputation or other characteristics attributable to that geographical origin and the production and/or processing and/or preparation of which take place in the defined geographical area.
3. Certain traditional geographical or non-geographical names designating an agricultural product or a foodstuff originating in a region or a specific place, which fulfil the conditions referred to in the second indent of paragraph 2 (a) shall also be considered as designations of origin.
4. By way of derogation from Article 2 (a), certain geographical designations shall be treated as designations of origin where the raw materials of the products concerned come from a geographical area larger than or different from the processing area, provided that:
- the production area of the raw materials is limited,
- special conditions for the production of the raw materials exist, and
- there are inspection arrangements to ensure that those conditions are adhered to.
5. For the purposes of paragraph 4, only live animals, meat and milk may be considered as raw materials. Use of other raw materials may be authorized in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 15.
6. In order to be eligible for the derogation provided for in paragraph 4, the designations in question may be or have already been recognized as designations of origin with national protection by the Member State concerned, or, if no such scheme exists, have a proven, traditional character and an exceptional reputation and renown.
7. In order to be eligible for the derogation provided for in paragraph 4, applications for registration must be lodged within two years of the entry into force of this Regulation.
Article 3
1. Names that have become generic may not be registered.
For the purposes of this Regulation, a 'name that has become generic` means the name of an agricultural product or a foodstuff which, although it relates to the place or the region where this product or foodstuff was originally produced or marketed, has become the common name of an agricultural product or a foodstuff.
To establish whether or not a name has become generic, account shall be taken of all factors, in particular:
- the existing situation in the Member State in which the name originates and in areas of consumption,
- the existing situation in other Member States,
- the relevant national or Community laws.
Where, following the procedure laid down in Articles 6 and 7, an application of registration is rejected because a name has become generic, the Commission shall publish that decision in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
2. A name may not be registered as a designation of origin or a geographical indication where it conflicts with the name of a plant variety or an animal breed and as a result is likely to mislead the public as to the true origin of the product.
3. Before the entry into force of this Regulation, the Council, acting by a qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, shall draw up and publish in the Official Journal of the European Communities a non-exhaustive, indicative list of the names of agricultural products or foodstuffs which are within the scope of this Regulation and are regarded under the terms of paragraph 1 as being generic and thus not able to be registered under this Regulation.
Article 4
1. To be eligible to use a protected designation of origin (PDO) or a protected geographical indication (PGI) an agricultural product or foodstuff must comply with a specification.
2. The product specification shall include at least:
(a) the name of the agricultural product or foodstuffs, including the designation of origin or the geographical indication;
(b) a description of the agricultural product or foodstuff including the raw materials, if appropriate, and principal physical, chemical, microbiological and/or organoleptic characteristics of the product or the foodstuff;
(c) the definition of the geographical area and, if appropriate, details indicating compliance with the requirements in Article 2 (4);
(d) evidence that the agricultural product or the foodstuff originates in the geographical area, within the meaning of Article 2 (2) (a) or (b), whichever is applicable;
(e) a description of the method of obtaining the agricultural product or foodstuff and, if appropriate, the authentic and unvarying local methods;
(f) the details bearing out the link with the geographical environment or the geographical origin within the meaning of Article 2 (2) (a) or (b), whichever is applicable;
(g) details of the inspection structures provided for in Article 10;
(h) the specific labelling details relating to the indication PDO or PGI, whichever is applicable, or the equivalent traditional national indications;
(i) any requirements laid down by Community and/or national provisions.
Article 5
2. A group or a natural or legal person may apply for registration only in respect of agricultural products or foodstuffs which it produces or obtains within the meaning of Article 2 (2) (a) or (b).
3. The application for registration shall include the product specification referred to in Article 4.
4. The application shall be sent to the Member State in which the geographical area is located.
5. The Member State shall check that the application is justified and shall forward the application, including the product specification referred to in Article 4 and other documents on which it has based its decision, to the Commission, if it considers that it satisfies the requirements of this Regulation.
If the application concerns a name indicating a geographical area situated in another Member State also, that Member State shall be consulted before any decision is taken.
1. Within a period of six months the Commission shall verify, by means of a formal investigation, whether the registration application includes all the particulars provided for in Article 4.
The Commission shall inform the Member State concerned of its findings.
2. If, after taking account of paragraph 1, the Commission concludes that the name qualifies for protection, it shall publish in the Official Journal of the European Communities the name and address of the applicant, the name of the product, the main points of the application, the references to national provisions governing the preparation, production or manufacture of the product and, if necessary, the grounds for its conclusions.
3. If no statement of objections is notified to the Commission in accordance with Article 7, the name shall be entered in a register kept by the Commission entitled 'Register of protected designations of origin and protected geographical indications`, which shall contain the names of the groups and the inspection bodies concerned.
4. The Commission shall publish in the Official Journal of the European Communities:
- the names entered in the Register,
- amendments to the Register made in accordance with Article 9 and 11.
5. If, in the light of the investigation provided for in paragraph 1, the Commission concludes that the name does not qualify for protection, it shall decide, in accordance with the procedure provided for in Article 15, not to proceed with the publication provided for in paragraph 2 of this Article.
Before publication as provided for in paragraphs 2 and 4 and registration as provided for in paragraph 3, the Commission may request the opinion of the Committee provided for in Article 15.
Article 7
1. Within six months of the date of publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities referred to in Article 6 (2), any Member State may object to the registration.
2. The competent authorities of the Member States shall ensure that all persons who can demonstrate a legitimate economic interest are authorized to consult the application. In addition and in accordance with the existing situation in the Member States, the Member States may provide access to other parties with a legitimate interest.
3. Any legitimately concerned natural or legal person may object to the proposed registration by sending a duly substantiated statement to the competent authority of the Member State in which he resides or is established. The competent authority shall take the necessary measures to consider these comments or objection within the deadlines laid down.
4. A statement of objection shall be admissible only if it:
- either shows non-compliance with the conditions referred to in Article 2,
- or shows that the proposed registration of a name would jeopardize the existence of an entirely or partly identical name or trade mark or the existence of products which are legally on the market at the time of publication of this regulation in the Official Journal of the European Communities,
- or indicates the features which demonstrate that the name whose registration is applied for is generic in nature.
5. Where an objection is admissible within the meaning of paragraph 4, the Commission shall ask the Member States concerned to seek agreement among themselves in accordance with their internal procedures within three months. If:
(a) agreement is reached, the Member States in question shall communicate to the Commission all the factors which made agreement possible together with the applicant's opinion and that of the objector. Where there has been no change to the information received under Article 5, the Commission shall proceed in accordance with Article 6 (4). If there has been a change, it shall again initiate the procedure laid down in Article 7;
(b) no agreement is reached, the Commission shall take a decision in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 15, having regard to traditional fair practice and of the actual likelihood of confusion. Should it decide to proceed with registration, the Commission shall carry out publication in accordance with Article 6 (4).
Article 8
The indications PDO, PGI or equivalent traditional national indications may appear only on agricultural products and foodstuffs that comply with this Regulation.
Article 9
The Member State concerned may request the amendment of a specification, in particular to take account of developments in scientific and technical knowledge or to redefine the geographical area.
The Article 6 procedure shall apply mutatis mutandis.
The Commission may, however, decide, under the procedure laid down in Article 15, not to apply the Article 6 procedure in the case of a minor amendment.
Article 10
1. Member States shall ensure that not later than six months after the entry into force of this Regulation inspection structures are in place, the function of which shall be to ensure that agricultural products and foodstuffs bearing a protected name meet the requirements laid down in the specifications.
2. An inspection structure may comprise one or more designated inspection authorities and/or private bodies approved for that purpose by the Member State. Member States shall send the Commission lists of the authorities and/or bodies approved and their respective powers. The Commission shall publish those particulars in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
3. Designated inspection authorities and/or approved private bodies must offer adequate guarantees of objectivity and impartiality with regard to all producers or processors subject to their control and have permanently at their disposal the qualified staff and resources necessary to carry out inspection of agricultural products and foodstuffs bearing a protected name.
If an inspection structure uses the services of another body for some inspections, that body must offer the same guarantees. In that event the designated inspection authorities and/or approved private bodies shall, however, continue to be responsible vis-√†-vis the Member State for all inspections.
As from 1 January 1998, in order to be approved by the Member States for the purpose of this Regulation, private bodies must fulfil the requirements laid down in standard EN 45011 of 26 June 1989.
4. If a designated inspection authority and/or private body in a Member State establishes that an agricultural product or a foodstuff bearing a protected name of origin in that Member State does not meet the criteria of the specification, they shall take the steps necessary to ensure that this Regulation is complied with. They shall inform the Member State of the measures taken in carrying out their inspections. The parties concerned must be notified of all decisions taken.
5. A Member State must withdraw approval from an inspection body where the criteria referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3 are no longer fulfilled. It shall inform the Commission, which shall publish in the Official Journal of the European Communities a revised list of approved bodies.
6. The Member States shall adopt the measures necessary to ensure that a producer who complies with this Regulation has access to the inspection system.
7. The costs of inspections provided for under this Regulation shall be borne by the producers using the protected name.
Article 11
1. Any Member State may submit that a condition laid down in the product specification of an agricultural product or foodstuff covered by a protected name has not been met.
2. The Member State referred to in paragraph 1 shall make its submission to the Member State concerned. The Member State concerned shall examine the complaint and inform the other Member State of its findings and of any measures taken.
3. In the event of repeated irregularities and the failure of the Member States concerned to come to an agreement, a duly substantiated application must be sent to the Commission.
4. The Commission shall examine the application by consulting the Member States concerned. Where appropriate, having consulted the committee referred to in Article 15, the Commission shall take the necessary steps. These may include cancellation of the registration.
Article 12
1. Without prejudice to international agreements, this Regulation may apply to an agricultural product or foodstuff from a third country provided that:
- the third country concerned is prepared to provide protection equivalent to that available in the Community to corresponding agricultural products for foodstuffs coming from the Community.
2. If a protected name of a third country is identical to a Community protected name, registration shall be granted with due regard for local and traditional usage and the practical risks of confusion.
Use of such names shall be authorized only if the country of origin of the product is clearly and visibly indicated on the label.
Article 13
1. Registered names shall be protected against:
(a) any direct or indirect commercial use of a name registered in respect of products not covered by the registration in so far as those products are comparable to the products registered under that name or insofar as using the name exploits the reputation of the protected name;
(b) any misuse, imitation or evocation, even if the true origin of the product is indicated or if the protected name is translated or accompanied by an expression such as 'style`, 'type`, 'method`, 'as produced in`, 'imitation` or similar;
(c) any other false or misleading indication as to the provenance, origin, nature or essential qualities of the product, on the inner or outer packaging, advertising material or documents relating to the product concerned, and the packing of the product in a container liable to convey a false impression as to its origin;
(d) any other practice liable to mislead the public as to the true origin of the product.
Where a registered name contains within it the name of an agricultural product or foodstuff which is considered generic, the use of that generic name on the appropriate agricultural product or foodstuff shall not be considered to be contrary to (a) or (b) in the first subparagraph.
2. However, Member States may maintain national measures authorizing the use of the expressions referred to in paragraph 1 (b) for a period of not more than five years after the date of publication of this Regulation, provided that:
- the products have been marketed legally using such expressions for at least five years before the date of publication of this Regulation,
- the labelling clearly indicates the true origin of the product.
However, this exception may not lead to the marketing of products freely on the territory of a Member State where such expressions are prohibited.
3. Protected names may not become generic.
Article 14
1. Where a designation of origin or geographical indication is registered in accordance with this Regulation, the application for registration of a trade mark corresponding to one of the situations referred to in Article 13 and relating to the same type of product shall be refused, provided that the application for registration of the trade mark was submitted after the date of the publication provided for in Article 6 (2).
Trade marks registered in breach of the first subparagraph shall be declared invalid.
This paragraph shall also apply where the application for registration of a trade mark was lodged before the date of publication of the application for registration provided for in Article 6 (2), provided that that publication occured before the trade mark was registered.
Article 15
The Commission shall be assisted by a committee composed of the representatives of the Member States and chaired by the representative of the Commission.

COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 93/35/EEC of 14 June 1993 amending for the sixth time Directive 76/768/EEC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to cosmetic products
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 100a thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),
In cooperation with the European Parliament (2),
Having regard to the Opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),
Whereas the legal ambiguities in Directive 76/768/EEC (4) particularly in Articles 1 and 2, should be removed;
Whereas it has become apparent that it is desirable that data on the ingredients employed in cosmetic products be gathered so that all issues relating to their use and the resulting action at Community level may be assessed with a view, in particular, to the establishment of a common nomenclature of ingredients used in cosmetic products; whereas the gathering of that data can be facilitated if the Commission compiles an inventory of the ingredients concerned; whereas that inventory will be indicative and is not intended to constitute a limitative list of substances used in cosmetic products;
Whereas greater transparency is needed regarding the ingredients employed in cosmetics if the latter are to be placed on the market without any prior procedure, if the necessary information on the finished product is to be available solely at the place of manufacture or of initial importation into the Community and if better information is to be provided to the consumer; whereas such transparency should be achieved by indication of a product's function and of the ingredients used in a cosmetic product on its packaging; whereas where for practical reasons it is impossible to indicate the ingredients and any warnings regarding use on the container or the packaging, such particulars should be enclosed so that the consumer may have access to all necessary information;
Whereas, with regard to the finished cosmetic product, it should be made clear which information is to be made available to the monitoring authorities of the place of manufacture or of initial importation into the Community market; whereas that information should include all the necessary particulars relating to identity, quality, safety for human health and the effects claimed for the cosmetic product;
Whereas, however, for reasons of monitoring, the competent authority should be apprised of the place of manufacture and of the information needed for rapid and appropriate medical treatment in the event of difficulties;
Whereas the Commission should be authorized to amend Annexes I and VIII to Directive 76/768/EEC in view of their illustrative and technical nature;
HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:
Article 1

A "cosmetic product" shall mean any substance or preparation intended to be placed in contact with the various external parts of the human body (epidermis, hair system, nails, lips and external genital organs) or with the teeth and the mucous membranes of the oral cavity with a view exclusively or mainly to cleaning them, perfuming them, changing their appearance and/or correcting body odours and/or protecting them or keeping them in good condition.';
A cosmetic product put on the market within the Community must not cause damage to human health when applied under normal or reasonably foreseeable conditions of use, taking account, in particular, of the product's presentation, its labelling, any instructions for its use and disposal as well as any other indication or information provided by the manufacturer or his authorized agent or by any other person responsible for placing the product on the Community market.
The provision of such warnings shall not, in any event, exempt any person from compliance with the other requirements laid down in this Directive.';
3. the following subparagraph shall be added to Article 4 (1):
'(i) ingredients or combinations of ingredients tested on animals after 1 January 1998 in order to meet the requirements of this Directive.
If there has been insufficient progress in developing satisfactory methods to replace animal testing, and in particular in those cases where alternative methods of testing, despite all reasonable endeavours, have not been scientifically validated as offering an equivalent level of protection for the consumer, taking into account OECD toxicity test guidelines, the Commission shall, by 1 January 1997, submit draft measures to postpone the date of implementation of this provision, for a sufficient period, and in any case for no less than two years, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 10. Before submitting such measures, the Commission will consult the Scientific Committee on Cosmetology.
The Commission shall present an annual report to the European Parliament and the Council on progress in the development, validation and legal acceptance of alternative methods to those involving experiments on animals. That report shall contain precise data on the number and type of experiments relating to cosmetic products carried out on animals. The Member States shall be obliged to collect that information in addition to collecting statistics as laid down by Directive 86/609/EEC on the protection of animals used for experimental and other scientific purposes.

Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),
Whereas Council Directive 74/577/EEC (4) established rules on the stunning of animals before slaughter;
Whereas the European Convention for the Protection of Animals for Slaughter was approved on behalf of the Community by Council Decision 88/306/EEC (5); whereas the scope of the Convention is wider than existing Community rules on the matter;
Whereas national laws concerning the protection of animals at the time of slaughter or killing have an impact on the conditions of competition and accordingly on the operation of the common market in agricultural products;
Whereas there is therefore a need to establish common minimum standards for the protection of animals at the time of slaughter or killing in order to ensure rational development of production and to facilitate the completion of the internal market in animals and animal products;
Whereas at the time of slaughter or killing animals should be spared any avoidable pain or suffering;
Whereas, however, it is necessary to allow for technical and scientific experiments to be carried out and to take account of the particular requirements of certain religious rites;
Whereas the rules should also ensure satisfactory protection, at the time of slaughter or killing, for animals not covered by the Convention;
Whereas in the declaration on the protection of animals annexed to the Final Act of the Treaty on European Union, the Conference calls upon the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, as well as the Member States, when drafting and implementing Community legislation on the common agricultural policy, to pay full regard to the welfare requirements of animals;
Whereas in so doing Community action must comply with the requirements arising out of the principle of subsidiarity laid down in Article 3b of the Treaty;
Whereas Directive 74/577/EEC should be repealed,
HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:
2. It shall not apply to:
- technical or scientific experiments relating to the procedures mentioned in paragraph 1, carried out under the supervision of the competent authority,
- animals which are killed in cultural or sports events,

COMMISSION REGULATION (EEC) No 1785/93 of 30 June 1993 on the operative events for the agricultural conversion rates used in the fibre sector
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 3813/92 of 28 December 1992 on the unit of account and the conversion rates to be applied for the purposes of the common agricultural policy (1), and in particular Article 6 (2) thereof,
Whereas the aid introduced by Council Regulation (EEC) No 845/72 of 24 April 1972 laying down special measures to encourage silkworm rearing (2), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2059/92 (3), is granted for boxes of eggs from which worms have successfully been reared; whereas, therefore, the event by which the economic objective has been attained can, on average, be deemed to have taken place on 1 August of each marketing year; whereas that date may therefore be taken as the operative event for the agricultural conversion rate applicable to aid for silkworms;
Whereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 876/75 of 3 April 1975 defining the event in which the aid in respect of flax and hemp and of silkworms becomes due and payable (4), Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1426/86 of 14 May 1986 determining the operative event for private storage aid for flax and hemp fibres (5) and Article 15 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1201/89 of 3 May 1989 laying down rules implementing the system of aid cotton (6), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2328/92 (7), determine the operative events for the agricultural conversion rate on the basis of criteria and legal provisions which have been radically changed in the context of the new agrimonetary arrangements introduced by Regulation (EEC) No 3813/92; whereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1068/93 of 30 April 1993 on detailed rules for determining and applying the agricultural conversion rates (8) establishes operative events for the agricultural conversion rates, particularly those applicable to the amounts in question, on the basis of the new provisions;

The following subparagraph is hereby added to Article 15 of Regulation (EEC) No 1201/89:
Article 3
Regulations (EEC) No 876/75 and (EEC) No 1426/86 are hereby repealed.
Article 4
This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2771/75 of 29 October 1975 on the common organization of the market in eggs (1), and in particular Article 2 (2) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,

COUNCIL REGULATION (EEC) No 2847/93 of 12 October 1993 establishing a control system applicable to the common fisheries policy
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 43 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),
Whereas, to achieve this aim, it is necessary to include rules for the monitoring of conservation and resource management measures, structural measures and measures on the common organization of the market, and certain provisions to deal with failure to carry out these measures, which must apply to the entire fisheries sector from the producer to the consumer;
Whereas this system can only achieve the desired result if the industry recognizes that it is justified;
Whereas control is first and foremost the responsibility of the Member States; whereas the Commission should also seek to ensure that the Member States monitor and prevent infringements in an equitable manner; whereas, therefore, the Commission should be provided with the financial, legal and legislative means to carry out this task as effectively as possible;
Whereas experience gained in the application of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2241/87 of 23 July 1987 establishing certain control measures for fishing activities (5) has shown that there is a need to strengthen control of the application of the rules governing conservation of fishery resources;
Whereas compliance with measures for the conservation and management of fishery resources requires an increased sense of responsibility on the part of all operators in the fishing industry;
Whereas policy on the management of fishery resources, which is based in particular on total allowable catches (TACs) and quotas and technical measures, is to be supplemented by management of the fishing effort, which involves monitoring fishing activities and capacities;
Whereas, to ensure that all catches and landings are kept under surveillance, Member States must monitor in all maritime waters the activities of Community vessels and all related activities allowing verification of the implementation of the rules concerning the common fisheries policy;
Whereas it is vital that Member States cooperate at the operational level during inspections at sea of fishing activities, in order to permit effective and financially justifiable inspections, particularly of operations carried out in waters outside the jurisdiction or sovereignty of a Member State;
Whereas implementation of the common fisheries policy necessitates measures to monitor vessels flying the flag of a third country present in Community waters, and in particular a system for communicating their movements and the species held on board, without prejudice to the right of innocent passage in the territorial sea and freedom of navigation in the 200-mile fishing zone;
Whereas the implementation of pilot projects applicable to certain categories of vessels by the Member States in cooperation with the Commission will make it possible for the Council to decide, before 1 January 1996, whether a satellite surveillance system or an alternative system should be implemented;
Whereas the management of fisheries by the fixing of TACs requires detailed knowledge of the composition of catches, such knowledge being equally necessary for the other procedures provided for in Regulation (EEC) No 3760/92; whereas this requires the keeping of a logbook by each master of a fishing vessel;
Whereas it is necessary for the Member State of landing to be able to monitor landings on its territory, and to this end it is appropriate for fishing vessels registered in other Member States to notify the Member State of landing of their intention to land on its territory;
Whereas it is essential to clarify and confirm at the time of landing the information contained in the logbooks; whereas, to this end, it is necessary that those involved in the landing and marketing of catches should declare the quantities landed, transshipped, offered for sale of purchased;
Whereas, in order to provide exemptions from the obligation to keep a logbook or complete a landing declaration by small fishing vessels for which such an obligation would constitute a disproportionate burden in relation to their fishing capacity, it is necessary for each Member State to monitor the activities of such vessels by the implementation of a sampling plan;
Whereas, in order to ensure the respect of Community conservation and trade measures, all fishery products landed in or imported into the Community should be accompanied, up to the point of first sale, by a transport document identifying their origin;
Whereas limitations on catches must be managed at both Member State and Community level; whereas Member States should register landings and notify them to the Commission by computer transmission; whereas therefore it is necessary to provide for exceptions from this obligation for small quantities landed, the computer transmission of which would constitute a disproportionate administrative and financial burden for the authorities of the Member States;
Whereas, in order to ensure the conservation and management of all the resources used, the provisions relating to the logbook, the landing and sales declarations and the information concerning transshipments and registration of catches may be extended to stocks which are not subject to a TAC or quota;
Whereas the Member States must be informed of the results of the activities of their vessels in waters under the jurisdiction of third countries or in international waters; whereas the masters of these vessels should accordingly be subject to the obligations relating to the logbook and the landing and transshipment declarations; whereas the information gathered by the Member States should be sent to the Commission;
Whereas the management of the collection and treatment of date requires the creation of computerised data bases enabling, in particular, cross checking of data; whereas therefore the Commission and its agents must have access to these data bases by computer transmission to carry out verification of the data;
Whereas compliance with the provisions relating to the use of fishing gear cannot be adequately ensured where nets of different mesh sizes are carried on board, unless they are subject to additional control measures; whereas for specific fisheries it may be appropriate to establish specific rules such as the one-net rule;
Whereas it is necessary that, when the quota of a Member State is exhausted or when the TAC itself is exhausted, fishing should be prohibited by a Commission decision;
Whereas it is necessary to repair the prejudice suffered by a Member State which has not exhausted its quota, its allocation of part of a stock or group of stocks when the fishery has been closed following the exhaustion of a TAC; whereas to this end a system of compensation should be provided for;
Whereas, in cases where this Regulation has not been respected by those responsible for fishing vessels should be made subject to additional control measures for conservation purposes;
Whereas it is necessary, in order to guarantee efficient management of the measures adopted, to provide for declaration mechanisms in conformity with the management objectives and strategies as laid down in Article 8 of Regulation (EEC) No 3760/92, applicable to a Member State which has overfished its quota;
Whereas one of the main aims of the common fisheries policy is to adjust fishing capacities to available resources; whereas Article 11 of Regulation (EEC) No 3760/92 stipulates that it is the task of the Council to set the objectives and strategies for the restructuring of fishing effort; whereas it is also necessary that compliance with the measures on the common organization of the market be assured, in particular by persons to whom these measures apply; whereas, therefore, it is vital that each Member State carry out, in addition to the financial checks already provided for in Community rules, technical checks to ensure that the provisions set by the Council are complied with;
Whereas it is necessary to establish general rules to allow Community inspectors appointed by the Commission to ensure the uniform application of Community rules and to verify the control carried out by the competent authorities of Member States;
Whereas, in order to safeguard the objectivity of verifications, it is important that Community inspectors may, in certain conditions, effect missions without prior notice and in an independent way, so as to verify the control operations carried out by the competent authorities of Member States; whereas such missions will in no circumstances imply control of private persons;
Whereas the action taken following infringements may differ from one Member State to another; causing fishermen to feel unfairly treated; whereas the absence of dissuasive sanctions in certain Member States reduced the effectiveness of controls and whereas, in the light of these observations, Member States should take all the necessary non-discriminatory measures to guard against and prosecute irregularities, particularly by establishing a roster of sanctions which effectively deprive the wrong-doers of the commercial gain resulting from their infringements;
Whereas the possibility for the flag Member State to ensure that the rules of the conservation and management of fishery resources are observed is reduced in cases where the Member State of landing does not effectively prosecute irregularities; whereas provision must therefore be made to count catches made illegally against the quota of the Member State of landing if that State has not brought effective proceedings;
Whereas Member States should report regularly to the Commission on their inspections activities and on the measures taken following infringements of Community measures;
Whereas for certain measures laid down by this Regulation it is appropriate to provide for detailed rules of implementation;
Whereas the confidentiality of the data collected in the framework of this Regulation should be guaranteed;
Whereas this Regulation should not affect the national provisions on monitoring, which, while coming within its scope, go beyond its minimum provisions, provided however that such national provisions are in conformity with Community law;
Whereas Regulation (EEC) No 2241/87 should be repealed, exception being made, however, for Article 5 which should remain in force, pending the adoption of the lists referred to in Article 6 (2) of this Regulation;
Whereas it is necessary to provide a transitional period for the implementation of specific provisions contained in certain Articles in order to allow the competent authorities of the Member States to establish and adapt their procedures to the requirements of the new Regulation;
Whereas the provisions of certain Articles, insofar as they concern fisheries operations in the Mediterranean Sea, where the common fisheries policy has not yet been integrally applied, should enter into force on 1 January 1989,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
- conservation and resource management measures,
- structural measures,
- measure concerning the common organization of the market,
as well as certain provisions relating to the effectiveness of sanctions to be applied in cases where the above-mentioned measures are not observed.
2. To this end, each Member State shall adopt, in accordance with Community rules, appropriate measures to ensure the effectiveness of the system. It shall place sufficient means at the disposal of its competent authorities to enable them to perform their tasks of inspection and control as laid down in this Regulation.
Article 2
1. In order to ensure compliance with all the rules in force concerning conservation and control measures, each Member State shall, within its territory and within maritime waters subject to its sovereignty or jurisdiction, monitor fishing activity and related activities. It shall inspect fishing vessels and investigate all activities thus enabling verification of the implementation of this Regulation, including the activities of landing, selling, transporting and storing fish and recording landings and sales.
2. Fishing vessels, which may exercise activities, flying the flag of third country and sailing in maritime waters subject to the sovereignty or jurisdiction of a Member State shall be subject to a system of communication of movements and of catches held on board.
Member States shall notify the Commission of the measures taken to ensure compliance with these procedures.
3. Each Member State shall monitor, outside the Community fishery zone, the activities of its vessels in cases where such control is required to ensure compliance with Community rules applicable in those waters.
4. In order to ensure that inspection is as effective and economical as possible, Member States shall coordinate their control activities. To that end, they may set up joint inspection programmes to allow the inspection of Community fishing vessels in the waters referred to in paragraphs 1 and 3. They shall take measures to permit their competent authorities and the Commission to be regularly informed on a reciprocal basis of the experience gained.
Article 3
1. In order to improve the effectiveness of surveillance of fishing activities, the Council shall decide before 1 January 1996, according to the procedure laid down in Article 43 of the Treaty, if and to what extend and when a continuous position monitoring system, either land- or satellite-based and using satellite communications for data transmission, shall be installed for Community fishing vessels.
2. In order to assets the technology to be used and the vessels to be included in the abovementioned system, Member States, in cooperation with the Commission, shall carry out pilot projects before 30 June 1995. To this end, Member States shall ensure that a continuous position monitoring system, either land- or satellite-based and using satellite communications for data transmission, is installed for certain categories of Community vessels.
Member States may carry out simultaneously pilot projects with a view to assessing the use of automatic position recorders.
3. When carrying out the pilot projects mentioned in paragraph 2, the Member State whose flag a vessel is flying or in which a vessel is registered shall take the necessary measures to ensure that the data transmitted by or recovered from, its fishing vessels are recorded in computer-readable form, regardless of the waters in which they are operating or the port they are in.
Where its fishing vessels are operating in waters subject to the sovereignty or jurisdiction of another Member State, the flag Member State shall ensure immediate communication of these data to the competent authorities of the Member State concerned.
1. The inspection and monitoring specified in Article 2 shall be carried out by each Member State on its own account by means of a system of inspection decided by the Member State.
In carrying out the tasks entrusted to them, Member Sates shall ensure that the provisions and measures referred to in Article 2 are complied with. Moreover, they shall act in such a way as to avoid undue interference with normal fishing activities. They shall also ensure that there is no discrimination as regards the sectdor and vessels chosen for inspection.
2. The persons responsible for the fishing vessels, premises or transport vehicles inspected shall cooperate in facilitating inspections carried out in accordance with paragraph 1.
Article 5
In accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 36, detailed rules may be adopted for the implementation of Articles 2, 3 and 4, concerning in particular:
(a) the identification of officially designated inspectors, of inspection vessels and of such other like means of inspection as may be used by a Member State;
(b) the procedure to be used by inspectors and masters of fishing vessels if an inspector wishes to board a vessel;

Article 11
1. Without prejudice to Articles 7, 8 and 9, the master of a Community fishing vessels who:
- transships to another vessel, hereinafter referred to as 'the receiving vessel`, any quantities of catches of a stock or group of stocks subject to a TAC or quota irrespective of the place of transhipment, or
- directly lands such quantities outside Community territory,
shall, at the time of the transshipment or of the landing, inform the Member State whose flag his vessel is flying, or in which his vessel is registered, of the species and quantities involved and of the date of transshipment or of landing and of the location of catches by reference to the smallest zone for which a TAC or quota has been fixed.
2. At the latest 24 hours before the beginning and at the end of a transshipment or a series or transshipments, when this takes place in a port or in maritime waters subject to the sovereignty or jurisdiction of a Member State, the master of the receiving vessel shall inform the competent authorities of that Member State of the quantities of catches of a stock or group of stocks subject to a TAC or quota on board his vessel.
The master of the receiving vessel shall keep details of the quantities of catches of a stock or group of stocks subject to a TAC or quota received by transshipment, of the date of receipt, and of the vessel transshipping such catches to the receiving vessel. This requirement shall be deemed to be met by retaining copies of the transshipment declaration provided in accordance with the detailed rules for recording information on Member States' catches of fish.
At the end of the transshipment or series of transshipments, the master of the receiving vessel shall transmit these details to the competent authorities referred to above within 24 hours.
The master of the receiving vessel shall also keep details of the quantities of catches of a stock or group of stocks subject to a TAC or quota which are transshipped by the receiving vessel to a third vessel, and shall inform the aforementioned competent authorities of such transshipment at least 24 hours before it takes place. Following transshipment, the master shall inform the said authorities of the quantities transshipped.
The masters of the receiving vessel and of the third vessel referred to above shall permit the competent authorities to verify the accuracy of the information and details required by this paragraph.

Member States shall take appropriate measures to verify the accuracy of the information received under paragraphs 1 and 2, and shall, where appropriate, inform the Member State or Member States in which the receiving vessel and the fishing vessel transshipping to the receiving vessel are registered, or whose flag they are flying, of such information and of the results of verification.
4. Paragraphs 2 and 3 shall also apply to a receiving vessel flying the flag of, or registered in a third country.
Article 12
Where transshipment or landing is to take place more than 15 days after the catch, the information required in Articles 8 and 11 shall be submitted to the competent authorities of the Member State whose flag the vessels are flying or in which the vessels are registered not later than 15 days after the catch.
Article 13
1. All fisheries products landed in or imported into the Community, either unprocessed or after having been processed on board and which are transported to a place other than that of landing or import, shall be accompanied by a document drawn up by the transporter until the first sale has taken place.
2. This document shall:
(a) indicate the origin of the consignment (name of vessel and its external identification);
(b) include the place of destination of the consignment(s) and the identification of the transport vehicle;
(c) indicate the quantities of fish (in kilogrammes processed weight) for each species transported, the names of the consignee and the place and the date of loading.
3. Each transporter must ensure that the document cited in paragraph 1 contains as a minimum all the information requested in paragraph 2.
4. The transporter shall be exempt from the obligation fixed in paragraph 1 if one of the following conditions is satisfied:
(a) the document mentioned in paragraph 1 is replaced by a copy of one of the declarations provided for in Articles 8 or 10 pertaining to the quantities transported;
(b) the document mentioned in paragraph 1 is replaced by a copy of document T 2 M indicating the origin of the quantities transported.

1. Member States shall ensure that all landings in a Member State as mentioned in Articles 8, 9 and 10 shall be recorded. For this purpose, Member States may require that the first marketing be by sale at an auction centre.
2. Where landings of catches are not placed on the market for the first time by sale at auction, as provided for in Article 9 (2), Member States shall ensure that the quantities involved are notified to the auction centres or other bodies authorised by Member States.
3. The information on landings by certain categories of vessels subject to the derogations mentioned in Articles 7 and 8 or on landings in ports which do not have a sufficiently developed administrative structure to register landings may, at the request of a Member State to the Commission, within 12 months of the entry into force of this Regulation, be exempted from the requirement for such information to be processed. Exemption may be agreed if the registration of the requested data would create disproportionate difficulties for the national authorities in relation to the total landings, and if the respective species landed are sold locally. A list of ports and vessels qualifying for such exemption shall be established by each Member State and notified to the Commission.
4. A Member State benefiting from the derogation mentioned in paragraph 3 shall establish a sampling plan in order to evaluate the extent of respective landings in the qualifying ports. This plan must be approved by the Commission before any derogation is applied. The Member State shall regularly transmit to the Commission the results of evaluations.
Article 15

Each Member State shall inform the Commission of a quota consumption forecast with anticipated date of exhaustion in respect of the species for which the catches made by fishing vessels flying its flag or registered there are deemed to have exhausted 70 % of the quota, allocation or share available to that Member State.
Member States shall, where catches of stocks or groups of stocks subject to TACs or quotas may reach TAC or quota levels, provide the Commission, at its request, with more detailed or more frequent information than this paragraph requires.
2. The Commission shall keep available to Member States on computer the notifications received pursuant to this Article.
3. Where the Commission finds that a Member State has not complied with the deadline for transmitting the data on monthly catches as provided for in paragraph 1, it may set the date on which, for a stock or group of stocks, the catches subject to a quota or other form of quantity restriction and taken by fishing vessels flying the flag of, or registered in, that Member State shall be deemed to have exhausted 70 % of the quota, allocation or share available to that Member State and may set the estimated date on which the quota, allocation or available share shall be deemed to be exhausted.
4. Each Member State shall notify the Commission by computer transmission, before the end of the first month of each calendar quarter of the quantities of stocks other than those mentioned in paragraph 1 landed during the preceding quarter.
Article 16
1. Without prejudice to Article 15, Member States shall provide, at the request of the interested Member State, data on landings, offers for sale or transshipments of fishery products carried out in their ports of waters under their jurisdiction by fishing vessels flying the flag of, or registered in that Member State and based on a stock or group of stocks subject to a quota allocated to that Member State.
This information shall consist of the name and the external identification mark of the vessel in question, the quantities of fish by stock or groups of stocks landed, offered for sale or transshipped by that vessel as well as the date and place of landing, offer for first sale or transshipment. This information shall be transmitted within four working days following the date of the request of the interested Member State or within a further period of time which may be determined by that Member State or the Member State of landing.
2. The Member State where the landing, offer for first sale or the transshipment has taken place, shall transmit to the Commission at its request this information at the same time as it is being communicated to the Member State where the vessel is registered.
Article 17
1. Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure monitoring of the catches of species made by their vessels operating in waters subject to the sovereignty or jurisdiction of third countries and on the high seas, and to ensure verification and recording of transshipments and landings of such catches.
2. The control and verification measures shall ensure compliance with the following obligations on the part of the vessel owners and/or masters:
- a logbook shall be kept on board the fishing vessels in which the masters shall record their catches,
- a landing declaration shall be submitted to the authorities of the Member State of landing during landings carried out in Community ports,
- the flag Member State shall be informed of the details of each transshipment of fish on to third-country fishing vessels and of landings carried out directly in third countries.
3. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall apply without prejudice to the provisions of the fisheries agreements concluded between the Community and third countries and International Conventions to which the Community is a party.
Article 18
1. Each Member State shall notify the Commission by computer transmission before the end of the first month of each calendar quarter of the quantities caught in the fishing waters referred to in Article 17 and landed during the previous quarter and of all information received pursuant to Article 17 (2).
2. Four catches made in third country waters the information notified in accordance with paragraph 1 shall be broken down by third country and stock by reference to the smallest statistical zone defined for the fishery concerned.
Catches made on the high seas shall be notified by reference to the smallest statistical zone defined by the International Convention governing the catch location and by species or group of species for all the stocks in the fishery concerned.
3. Before 1 October each year, the Commission shall make available to the Member States the information it receives pursuant to this Article.
Article 19
1. In order to ensure respect of the obligations laid down in Articles 3, 6, 8, 9, 10, 14 and 17, each Member State shall establish a validation system comprising in particular cross-checks and verification of data resulting from these obligations.
2. In order to facilitate these verifications, each Member State shall create a computerized data base where the data referred to in paragraph 1 are registered.
Member States may create decentralised data bases on condition that these and the procedures relating to the collection and registration of data are standardized so as to ensure compatibility between them throughout the territory of the Member State.
3. In the case where a Member State is unable to conform immediately to the requirements of paragraph 2, for all or part of its fisheries, the Commission may at its request decide to accord a transitional period of up to a maximum of three years from the date of entry into force of this Regulation, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 36.
4. A Member State obtaining such derogations shall keep, by means of non-computerized documentation, records of the data referred to in paragraph 1 for a period of three years and shall establish a sampling plan approved by the Commission so as to enable on the spot verification of the accuracy of this data. The Commission may carry out verification on the spot, in its own right, in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the sampling plan.
5. During the twelve months following the entry into force of this Regulation, each Member State shall submit to the Commission a report describing the way in which data is collected and verified, specifying the reliability of such data. The Commission, in cooperation with the Member States, shall draw up a summary of these reports which it shall communicate to them.
6. Detailed rules for implementation of this Article shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 36.
Article 20
1. All catches which have been retained on board any Community fishing vessel shall comply with the species composition laid down in Council Regulation (EEC) No 3094/86 of 7 October 1986 laying down certain technical measures for the conservation of fishery resources (6) for the net carried on board that vessel.
Nets on board vessels which are not used must be stowed so that they may not readily be used in accordance with the following conditions:
(a) nets, weights and similar gear shall be disconnected from their trawl boards and towing and hauling wires and ropes,
(b) nets which are on or above deck shall be securely lashed to some part of the superstructure.
2. If catches which have been retained on board any Community fishing vessel have been taken with nets with different minimum mesh sizes during the same voyage, the species composition shall be calculated for each part of the catch which has been taken under different conditions.
To that end, all changes from the mesh size previously used as well as the catch composition on board at the moment of any such change shall be entered into the logbook and the landing declaration. In specific cases, detailed rules on the keeping on board of a stowage plan, by species, of products processed, indicating where they are located in the hold, shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 36.
3. Notwithstanding paragraphs 1 and 2 the Council may, on the basis of a report drawn up by the Commission, decide by qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, that:
(a) no Community fishing vessel participating in particular fisheries may carry nets of different minimum mesh sizes during a single fishing trip;
(b) specific rules shall apply to the use of nets of different mesh size for specific fisheries.
Article 21
1. All catches of a stock or group of stocks subject to quota made by Community fishing vessels shall be charged against the quota applicable to the flag Member State for the stock or group of stocks in question, irrespective of the place of landing.
2. Each Member State shall determine the date from which the catches of a stock or group of stocks subject to quota made by the fishing vessels flying its flag or registered in that Member State shall be deemed to have exhausted the quota applicable to it for that stock or group of stocks. As from that date, it shall provisionally prohibit fishing for that stock or group of stocks by such vessels as well as the retention on board, the transshipment and the landing of fish taken after that date and shall decide on a date up to which transshipments and landings or final declarations of catches are permitted. The Commission shall be notified forthwith of this measure and shall then inform the other Member States.
3. Following notification under paragraph 2 or on its own initiative, the Commission shall fix, on the basis of the information available, the date on which, for a stock or group of stocks, the catches subject to a TAC, quota or other quantitative limitation made by fishing vessels flying the flag of, or registered in, any Member State are deemed to have exhausted the quota, allocation or share available to that Member State or, as the case may be, to the Community.
When an assessment of this situation as referred to in the first subparagraph is made, the Commission shall advise the Member States concerned of the prospects of fishing being halted as a result of a TAC being exhausted.
Community fishing vessels shall cease fishing in respect of a stock or of a group of stocks subject to a quota or TAC on the date on which the quota allocated for the stock or group of stocks in question to that Member State is deemed to have been exhausted or on the date on which the TAC for the species constituting the stock or group of stocks in question is deemed to have been exhausted; such vessels shall equally cease retention on board, transshipment, landing or arranging for transshipment or landing in respect of catches of such stocks or group of stocks taken after that date.
4. When the Commission has, by virtue of the first subparagraph of paragraph 3, halted fishing because of the alleged exhaustion of the TAC, quota, allocation or share available to the Community and it transpires that a Member State has not in fact exhausted its quota, allocation or share of the stock or group of stocks concerned, the following provisions shall apply.
If the prejudice suffered by the Member State for which fishing has been prohibited before its quota was exhausted has not been removed by action in accordance with Article 9 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 3760/92, measures shall be adopted with the aim of remedying in an appropriate manner the prejudice caused, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 36. These measures may involve making deductions from the quota, allocation or share of the Member State which has overfished, the quantities so deducted to be allocated appropriately to the Member Sates whose fishing activities were halted before their quotas were exhausted. These deductions and the consequent allocations shall be made taking into account as a matter of priority the species and zones for which the annual quotas, allocations or shares were fixed. These deductions or allocations may be made during the year in which the prejudice occurred or in the succeeding year or years.
Detailed rules for the application of this paragraph, and in particular for determining the quantities concerned, shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 36.
Article 22
Should the competent authorities of a Member State establish that the activities of a Community fishing vessel have seriously or repeatedly failed to comply with this Regulation, the flag Member State may subject the vessel in question to additional control measures.
The flag Member State shall inform the Commission and the other Member States of the name and external identifying marks and numbers of the vessel on which the said additional control measures have been imposed.
Article 23
1.

COUNCIL REGULATION (EEC) No 3089/93 of 29 October 1993 amending Regulation (EEC) No 2299/89 on a code of conduct for computerized reservation systems
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 84 (2) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),
Whereas Regulation (EEC) No 2299/89 (4) constitutes a significant step towards the achievement of undistorted competition between air carriers and between computer reservation systems, thereby protecting the interests of consumers;
Whereas it is necessary to extend the scope of Regulation (EEC) No 2299/89 and to clarify its provisions and it is appropriate to take these measures at Community level to ensure that the objectives of the Regulation are met in all Member States;
Whereas this Regulation is without prejudice to the application of Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty;
Whereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 83/91 (5) exempts agreements for the common purchase development and operation of computer reservation systems from the provisions of Article 85 (1) of the Treaty;
Whereas non-scheduled air services are of major importance in the territory of the Community;
Whereas the bulk of these journeys are package tours or bundled products, with air transport forming only one element of the whole product;
Whereas, in principle, 'seat-only' or unbundled products on non-scheduled air services compete directly with air transport products offered on scheduled services;
Whereas it is desirable to treat like products equally and to ensure fair competition between both kinds of air transport products and the neutral dissemination of information to the consumer;
Whereas it is appropriate to deal with all matters of use of computer reservation systems for all kinds of air transport products in the same Council Regulation;
Whereas consumers looking for different products should be given the possibility to request displays for only scheduled or non-scheduled flights;
Whereas it is desirable to clarify that Regulation (EEC) No 2299/89 should apply to computer reservation systems offered to and/or used by all final consumers, be they individual members of the public or corporate users;
Whereas air carriers using a computer reservation system in their own clearly marked offices or counters should not be subject to the provisions governing the principal display;
Whereas a clear distinction between a contract for participation in or allowing for use of a system and the supply of the technical equipment itself is appropriate, the latter being subject to normal contract law, thus allowing a system vendor to claim his direct costs in the case of the termination of a participation or subscription contract in accordance with the provisions of this Regulation;
Whereas the refusal by parent carriers to provide the same information on schedules, fares and availability to systems other than their own and to accept bookings made by those systems can seriously distort competition between computer reservation systems;
Whereas competitive neutrality of computer reservation systems for air carriers must be ensured in respect of equal functionality and data security, in particular through equal access to functions, information/data and interfaces and a clear separation between private airline facilities and distribution facilities;
Whereas competitive parity will be enhanced by ensuring the separate legal identity of computer reservation systems;
Whereas a parent carrier may enjoy unfair advantages arising from its control over its computer reservation system in the competition between air carriers; whereas, therefore, total equality of treatment of parent and participating carriers is necessary to the extent that a parent carrier uses the facilities of its own system which are covered by this Regulation;
Whereas it is desirable in the consumer's interest that a principal display be provided for each transaction requested by a consumer;
Whereas it is desirable that detailed marketing, booking and sales data shall be made available to participating carriers on a non-discriminatory basis and with equal timeliness; whereas identification or personal information on a passenger or a corporate user must remain private; whereas, therefore, a system vendor has to ensure by technical means and appropriate safeguards, at least regarding software, that no unauthorized access to information can take place;
Whereas billing information should be sufficiently detailed to allow participating carriers and subscribers to control their costs; whereas, in order to facilitate such control, such information should be made available on magnetic media;
Whereas it is desirable in the consumer interest to clarify that no flight or combination of flights shall be shown more than once in the principal display, except where, in a joint venture or other arrangement, each operating carrier assumes separate responsibility for the offer and sale of air transport products on the flights concerned;
Whereas the system vendor should ensure that the principles of technical compliance with the provisions concerning equal functionality and data security are monitored by an independent auditor,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
Regulation (EEC) No 2299/89 is hereby amended as follows:
This Regulation shall apply to computerized reservation systems to the extent that they contain air transport products, when offered for use and/or used in the territory of the Community, irrespective of:

COMMISSION DECISION of 23 February 1994 setting up an advisory committee for the coordination of fraud prevention (94/140/EC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Whereas the sound management of Community finances requires that fraud against the Community budget be effectively opposed;
Whereas it falls primarily to the Member States to take specific measures to combat fraud; whereas this calls for close cooperation between Member States and the Commission;
Whereas Article 209a of the Treaty requires Member States to take the same measures to counter fraud affecting the financial interests of the Community as they take to counter fraud affecting their own financial interests; whereas to this end they must, with the help of the Commission, coordinate the action they take to protect the financial interests of the Community and to counter fraud;
Whereas the Commission also has considerable responsibility arising from its general task of ensuring that the Community budget is properly implemented and that the Treaty provisions are applied;
Whereas it is therefore desirable that the Commission be advised by committee comprising representatives of the Member States which may be consulted on any matter relating to prevention, to cooperate between Member States and the Commission and to prosecution of fraud and on any other matter relating to the legal protection of the financial interests of the Community;
Whereas the existing committees specialize in specific areas only; whereas these committees are not to be replaced; whereas it is nevertheless useful to have an overall view of the whole area of fraud against the Community budget; whereas a horizontal committee therefore needs to be set up;
Whereas, since the committee is to be a horizontal one and Member States need to be represented at the appropriate level reflecting their own administrative structures, provision should be made for the committee to consist of two representatives for each Member State,
HAS DECIDED AS FOLLOWS:

COUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 163/94 of 24 January 1994 amending Regulation (EEC) No 386/90 on the monitoring carried out at the time of export of agricultural products receiving refunds or other amounts
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 43 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2),
Whereas, under Council Regulation (EEC) No 386/90 of 12 February 1990 on the monitoring carried out at the time of export of agricultural products receiving refunds or other amounts (3), the Commission must present to the Council a report on the progress of the application of the Regulation;
Whereas it is clear from this report and from the additional report that the lack of flexibility of some of the rules could hamper improvements in the effectiveness of the checks; whereas better use could be made of risk analysis if the inspection services had greater leeway for targeting their checks;
Whereas the obligation to comply with the rate of 5 % per product per customs office makes it more difficult to concentrate human resources on high risk exports;
Whereas, while keeping the overall rate at 5 %, it is possible to introduce some flexibility so as to enable the inspection services to target their checks on more sensitive products;
Whereas, in order to mitigate the risk of substitution, particularly in the case of export declarations presented and accepted within the Member State or at the premises of the exporter, provision must be made for the imposition of a minimum rate of physical checks by means of representative sampling by the office of exit;
Whereas, in view of the need to ensure effective application, throughout the Community, of the provisions concerning checks on export refunds and given the financial risks for the Community funds, rules must be adopted at Community level,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
Regulation (EEC) No 386/90 is hereby amended as follows:
- per customs office,
- per calendar year, and
- per product sector.
However, the rate of 5 % per product sector may be replaced by a rate of 5 % covering all sectors insofar as the Member State applies a selection system based on a risk analysis carried out in accordance with criteria to be laid down in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 6. In this case, a minimum rate of 2 % shall be compulsory per product sector.`
Article 2
This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 1966/94 of 28 July 1994 concerning the classification of certain goods in the combined nomenclature
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 of 23 July 1987 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the Common Customs Tariff (1), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1737/94 (2), and in particular Article 9 thereof,
Whereas in order to ensure uniform application of the combined nomenclature annexed to the said Regulation, it is necessary to adopt measures concerning the classification of the goods referred to in the Annex to this Regulation;
Whereas Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 has set down the general rules for the interpretation of the combined nomenclature and these rules also apply to any other nomenclature which is wholly or partly based on it or which adds any additional subdivisions to it and which is established by specific Community provisions, with a view to the application of tariff or other measures relating to trade in goods;
Whereas, pursuant to the said general rules, the goods described in column 1 of the table annexed to this Regulation must be classified under the appropriate CN codes indicated in column 2, by virtue of the reasons set out in column 3;
Whereas it is appropriate that, subject to the measures in force in the Community relating to double checking systems and to prior and retrospective Community surveillance of textile products on importation into the Community, binding tariff information in the matter of classification of goods in the combined nomenclature issued by the customs authorities of the Member States which do not conform to this Regulation may continue to be invoked in accordance with the provisions of Article 12 (6) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 of 12 October 1992, establishing the Community Customs Code (3), for a period of 60 days by the holder;
Whereas the tariff and statistical nomenclature section of the Customs Code Committee has not delivered an opinion with the time limit set by its chairman as regards products Nos 3, 5, 6, 7 in the annexed table;

Whereas, since the adoption of the Regulation, the Annexes have been amended a number of times; whereas, by reason of their number, their complexity and their dispersal among various Official Journals of the European Communities, the texts are difficult to use and thus lack the clarity which should be an essential feature of all legislation; whereas, they should therefore be consolidated; whereas on the same occasion the name or chemical description of some compounds should be rectified or made more precise and certain material errors should be corrected;
Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee for the adaptation to technical progress of directives on the removal of technical barriers to trade in the veterinary medicinal products sector,

COMMISSION DECISION of 10 February 1995 laying down special conditions governing imports of fishery and aquaculture products originating in Morocco (Text with EEA relevance) (95/30/EC)

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 91/493/EEC of 22 July 1991 laying down the health conditions for the production and the placing on the market of fishery products (1), and in particular Article 11 (1) thereof,
Whereas a group of Commission experts has conducted an inspection visit to Morocco to verify the conditions under which fishery products are produced, stored and dispatched to the Community;
Whereas the provisions of Morrocan legislation on health inspection and monitoring of fishery products may be considered equivalent to those laid down in Directive 91/493/EEC;
Whereas, in Morocco, 'Direction de l'Elevage, Minist√®re de l'Agriculture' (DEMA) is capable of effectively verifying the application of the laws in force;
Whereas the procedure for obtaining the health certificate referred to in Article 11 (4) (a) of Directive 91/493/EEC must also cover the definition of a model certificate, the minimum requirements regarding the language(s) in which it must be drafted and the grade of the person empowered to sign it;
Whereas, pursuant to Article 11 (4) (b) of Directive 91/493/EEC, a mark should be affixed to packages of fishery products giving the name of the third country and the approval number of the establishment of origin;
Whereas, pursuant to Article 11 (4) (c) of Directive 91/493/EEC, a list of approved establishments must be drawn up; whereas that list must be drawn up on the basis of a communication from the DEMA to the Commission; whereas it is therefore for the DEMA to ensure compliance with the provisions laid down to that end in Article 11 (4) of Directive 91/493/EEC;

COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 1368/95 of 16 June 1995 amending Regulation (EEC) No 2921/90 on aid for the production of casein and caseinates from skimmed milk
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 804/68 of 27 June 1968 on the common organization of the market in milk and milk products (1), as last amended by the Act of Accession of Austria, Finland and Sweden and by Regulation (EC) No 3290/94 (2), and in particular Article 11 (3) thereof,

Article 2

COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 1442/95 of 26 June 1995 amending Annexes I, II, III and IV of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 laying down a Community procedure for the establishment of maximum residue limits of veterinary medicinal products in foodstuffs of animal origin (Text with EEA relevance)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 of 26 June 1990 laying down a Community procedure for the establishment of maximum residue limits of veterinary medicinal products in foodstuffs of animal origin (1), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1441/95 (2), and in particular Article 6, 7 and 8 thereof,
Whereas, in accordance with Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90, maximum residue limits must be established progressively for all pharmacologically active substances which are used within the Community in veterinary medicinal products intended for administration to food-producing animals;
Whereas maximum residue limits should be established only after the examination within the Committee for Veterinary Medicinal Products of all the relevant information concerning the safety of residues of the substance concerned for the consumer of foodstuffs of animal origin and the impact of residues on the industrial processing of foodstuffs;
Whereas, in establishing maximum residue limits for residues of veterinary medicinal products in foodstuffs of animal origin, it is necessary to specify the animal species in which residues may be present, the levels which may be present in each of the relevant meat tissues obtained from the treated animal (target tissue) and the nature of the residue which is relevant for the monitoring of residues (marker residue);
Whereas, for the control of residues, as provided for in appropriate Community legislation maximum residue limits should usually be established for the target tissues of liver or kidney; whereas, however, the liver and kidney are frequently removed from carcases moving in international trade, and maximum residue limits should therefore also always be established for muscle or fat tissues;
Whereas, in the case of veterinary medicinal products intended for use in laying birds, lactating animals or honey bees, maximum residue limits must also be established for eggs, milk or honey;
Whereas carazolol, diazinon and spiramycin (applicable to the species cattle and chicken) should be inserted into Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90;
Whereas lecirelin, sodium dichloroisocyanurate, dinoprost tromethamine, hydrochloric acid, malic acid, l-tartaric acid and its mono- and di-basic salt of sodium, potassium and calcium, benzylalcohol, ethanol, n-butanol should be inserted into Annex II to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90;
Whereas, in order to allow for the completion of scientific studies, danofloxacin and erythromycin should be inserted into Annex III to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90;
Whereas, in order to allow for the completion of scientific studies, the duration of the validity of the provisional maximum residue limits previously defined in Annex III of Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 should be extended for tylosin and spiramycin (applicable to the species pigs);
Whereas it appears that maximum residue limits cannot be established for furazolidone because residues, at whatever limit, in foodstuffs of animal origin constitute a hazard to the health of the consumer; whereas furazolidone should therefore be inserted into Annex IV to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90;
Whereas a period of 60 days should be allowed before the entry into force of this Regulation in order to allow Member States to make any adjustment which may be necessary to the authorizations to place the veterinary medicinal products concerned on the market which have been granted in accordance with Council Directive 81/851/EEC (3), as last amended by Directive 93/40/EEC (4) to take account of the provisions of this Regulation;
Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee for the Adaptation to Technical Progress of the Directives on the Removal of Technical Barriers to Trade in the Veterinary Medicinal Products Sector,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
Annexes I, II, III and IV of Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 are hereby amended as set out in the Annex hereto.
Article 2
This Regulation shall enter into force on the sixtieth day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, in particular Article 100c (3) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament,
Whereas Article 100c (3) of the Treaty requires the Council to adopt measures relating to a uniform format for visas before 1 January 1996;
Whereas the introduction of a uniform format for visas is an important step towards the harmonization of visa policy; whereas Article 7a of the Treaty stipulates that the internal market shall comprise an area without internal frontiers in which the free movement of persons is ensured in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty; whereas this step is also to be regarded as forming a coherent whole with measures falling within Title VI of the Treaty on European Union;
Whereas it is essential that the uniform format for visas should contain all the necessary information and meet very high technical standards, notably as regards safeguards against counterfeiting and falsification; whereas it must also be suited to use by all the Member States and bear universally recognizable security features which are clearly visible to the naked eye;
Whereas this Regulation only lays down such specifications as are not secret; whereas these specifications need to be supplemented by further specifications which must remain secret in order to prevent counterfeiting and falsification and which may not include personal data or references to such data; whereas powers to adopt further specifications should be conferred on the Commission;
Whereas, to ensure that the information referred to is not made available to more persons than necessary, it is also essential that each Member State should designate not more than one body having responsibility for printing the uniform format for visas, with Member States remaining free to change the body, if need be; whereas, for security reasons, each Member State must communicate the name of the competent body to the Commission and the other Member States;
Whereas, to be effective, this Regulation should apply to all visas covered by Article 5; whereas Member States should be free also to use the uniform visa format for visas which can be used for purposes other than those covered by Article 5 provided differences visible to the naked eye are incorporated to make confusion with the uniform visa impossible;
Whereas, with regard to the personal data to be entered on the uniform format for visas in accordance with the Annex hereto, compliance should be ensured with Member States' data-protection provisions as well as with the relevant Community legislation,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
Visas issued by the Member States in conformity with Article 5 shall be produced in the form of a uniform format (sticker). They shall conform to the specifications set out in the Annex.
Article 2
Further technical specifications which render the visa difficult to counterfeit or falsify shall be laid down in accordance with the procedure set out in Article 6.

The same body may be designated by two or more Member States for this purpose. Each Member State shall be entitled to change its designated body. It shall inform the Commission and the other Member States accordingly.
Article 4
1. Without prejudice to the relevant more extensive provisions concerning data protection, an individual to whom a visa is issued shall have the right to verify the personal particulars entered on the visa and, where appropriate, to ask for any corrections or deletions to be made.
2. No information in machine-readable form shall be given on the uniform format for visas unless it also appears in the boxes described in points 6 to 12 of the Annex, or unless it is mentioned in the relevant travel document.
Article 5
For the purposes of this Regulation a 'visa' shall mean an authorization given by or a decision taken by a Member State which is required for entry into its territory with a view to:
- an intended stay in that Member State or in several Member States of no more than three months in all,
- transit through the territory or airport transit zone of that Member State or several Member States.
Article 6
1. Where reference is made to the procedure defined in this Article, the following provisions shall apply.
2. The Commission shall be assisted by a committee composed of the representatives of the Member States and chaired by the representative of the Commission.
The representative of the Commission shall submit to the committee a draft of the measures to be taken. The committee shall deliver its opinion on the draft within a time limit which the chairman may lay down according to the urgency of the matter. The opinion shall be delivered by the majority laid down in Article 148 (2) of the Treaty in the case of decisions which the Council is required to adopt on a proposal from the Commission. The votes of the representatives of the Member States within the committee shall be weighted in the manner set out in that Article. The chairman shall not vote.
3. (a) The Commission shall adopt the measures envisaged if they are in accordance with the opinion of the committee.

Whereas the Commission has received a specific mandate in the framework of Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 (4) to review a number of provisions of that Regulation by 1 July 1994 to submit any appropriate proposal for revision of that Regulation;
Whereas it has become apparent that the provisions, expiring on 1 July 1995 concerning the labelling of agricultural products and foodstuffs containing an ingredient of agricultural origin which was produced by producers converting to organic farming, should be extended in order to permit those producers to valorize the additional cost of their production by an appropriate labelling of their products;
Whereas the review of Articles 5, 10 and 11 requested by the Council by 1 July 1994 has shown that a number of technical and drafting amendments in those Articles as well as in certain other provisions are necessary to ensure a proper management and implementation of the Regulation; whereas priority has therefore been given to the establishment of these amended rules and that consequently the establishment of the rules concerning animal production should be postponed for a limited period;
Whereas it has become apparent from the review that the provisions concerning the labelling of foodstuffs prepared only partly from ingredients of agricultural origin which were produced according to organic production methods, should be improved in order to permit greater emphasis to be placed on the organically produced component in such foodstuffs;
Whereas it has also become apparent that the indication provided for in Annex V should remain optional, but should also, in order to prevent improper use of that indication, be restricted to sales of prepackaged foodstuffs or direct sales by the producer or preparer to the ultimate consumer, provided that the nature of the product can be identified unambiguously;
Whereas it has furthermore become apparent that propagating material should be obtained from organically grown plants but that a system of derogations is necessary in order to enable producers to use, during a transitional period, conventionally-produced propagating material, where no appropriate organically-produced propagating material is available;
Whereas, for the same reasons, it must be permissible for whole seedlings obtained in a conventional manner and intended for planting for plant production to be used for an interim period;
Whereas it has become apparent that a number of products which were used before the adoption of Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 in accordance with the codes of practice of organic farming followed in the Community, have not been included in Annex II of the Regulation; whereas the use of such products should be permitted to the extent that their use is also permitted in conventional agriculture;

Article 2
This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing he European Community, and in particular Article 84 (2) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (2),
Acting in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 189c of the Treaty (3),
Whereas the Community is seriously concerned by shipping casualties with loss of life;
Whereas the International Safety Management Code providing for the safe operation of ships and for pollution prevention, hereinafter referred to as the 'ISM Code', was adopted by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) through Assembly Resolution A.741(18) of 4 November 1993 in the presence of the Member States and, through its incorporation into the International Convention on the Safety of Life at Sea 1974, will apply to ro-ro passenger vessels from 1 July 1998;
Whereas this represents one of a series of measures to improve safety at sea; whereas the ISM Code is not yet of a mandatory but of a recommendatory nature;
Whereas safety of human life at sea may be effectively enhanced by applying the ISM Code strictly and on a mandatory basis;
Whereas the Community's most urgent concern is for the safety management of ro-ro passenger ferries; whereas a uniform and coherent implementation of the ISM Code in all Member States can constitute a step towards the safety management of ro-ro passenger ferries;
Whereas in its resolution of 22 December 1994 on the safety of roll-on/roll-off passenger ferries (4), the Council invited the Commission to submit a proposal on the advance mandatory application of the ISM Code to all regular roll-on/roll-off passenger ferry services operating to or from European ports, in compliance with international law;
Whereas strict and mandatory application of the ISM Code is required to ensure the establishment and proper maintenance of safety management systems by companies operating seagoing ro-ro passenger ferries both at ship and at company level;
Whereas action at Community level is the best way to ensure advance mandatory enforcement of the provisions of the ISM Code and effective control of its application, while avoiding distortion of competition between different Community ports and ro-ro ferries; whereas only a regulation, which is of direct applicability, can ensure such enforcement; whereas advance implementation requires that the Regulation be applicable as from 1 July 1996;
Whereas the advance mandatory implementation of the ISM Code to all ro-ro ferries regardless of their flag also takes into account the request contained in point 2 of IMO Resolution A.741(18) which strongly urges Governments to implement the Code as soon as possible, giving priority inter alia to passenger ships;
Whereas the safety of ships is the primary responsibility of flag States; whereas Member States can ensure compliance with adequate safety management rules by ferries flying their flag and companies operating them; whereas the only way to ensure the safety of all ro-ro ferries, irrespective of their flag, operating or wishing to operate on a regular service from their ports is for the Member States to require effective compliance with safety rules as a condition for operating on a regular service from their ports;
Whereas companies operating ro-ro ferries exclusively in sheltered waters between ports in the same Member State constitute a more limited risk and will need to assume a proportionately greater administrative work-load than other companies, and should therefore enjoy a temporary derogation;
Whereas it is necessary to identify the requirements under which the provisions of the ISM Code are enforced and to define the conditions for the issue and verification of the document of compliance and of the safety management certificate;
Whereas Member States might find it necessary to delegate or rely upon specialized bodies in order to fulfil their obligations pursuant to this Regulation; whereas the appropriate way of ensuring a uniform and adequate level of control is to require that such bodies should only be those which meet the requirements of Council Directive 94/57/EC of 22 November 1994 on common rules and standards for ship inspection and survey organizations and for the relevant activities of maritime administrations (1);
Whereas a Member State must have the possibility of suspending the operation of certain ro-ro ferries from its ports where it considers that there is a risk of serious danger to safety of life or property or the environment, subject to a decision to be taken in the framework of a regulatory committee, to which the Member States must conform;
Whereas a simplified procedure involving a committee of a regulatory nature is necessary to amend this Regulation taking into account developments at international level;
Whereas the rapid introduction of these safety rules raises specific technical and administative problems for Greece because of the very large number of companies established in Greece operating ferries under the Greek flag and exclusively between Greek ports; whereas a derogation of limited duration to cover this situation should therefore be granted bearing in mind in addition that regular passenger and ferry services between Greek ports have been excluded until 1 January 2004 from the freedom to provide services granted by Council Regulation (EEC) No 3577/92 of 7 December 1992 applying the principle of freedom to provide services to maritime transport within Member States (maritime cabotage) (2),
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
The purpose of this Regulation is to enhance the safe management, safe operation and pollution prevention of ro-ro passenger ferries operating to or from ports of the Member States of the Community on a regular service by ensuring that companies operating ro-ro ferries comply with the ISM Code through:
- the establishment and proper maintenance of shipboard and shore-based safety management systems by companies, and
- the control thereof by flag and port State administrations.
Article 2
For the purpose of this Regulation and with a view to the implementation of the ISM Code:
(a) 'ro-ro ferry' means a seagoing passenger vessel with facilities to enable road or rail vehicles to roll on and roll off the vessel, and carrying more than 12 passengers;
(b) 'regular service' means a series of ro-ro ferry crossings operated so as to serve traffic between the same two or more points, either:
1. according to a published timetable; or
2. with crossings so regular or frequent that they constitute a recognizable systematic series;
(c) 'company' means the owner of a ro-ro ferry or any other organization or person such as the manager, or the bareboat charterer, who has assumed responsibility for operating the ro-ro ferry from the owner;
(d) 'recognized organization' means a body recognized in compliance with the provisions of Directive 94/57/EC;
(e) 'ISM Code' means the International Management Code for the Safe Operation of Ships and for Pollution Prevention, adopted by the IMO through Assembly Resolution A.741(18) of 4 November 1993, and annexed to this Regulation;

Article 4
1. All companies shall comply with all the provisions of paragraphs 1.2 to 13.1 and of paragraph 13.3 of the ISM Code, as if the provisions thereof were mandatory, as a requirement for their vessels to provide regular services to or from a port of a Member State of the Community.
2. By way of derogation from paragraph 1, companies operating a ro-ro ferry or ferries on a regular service exclusively in sheltered waters between ports situated in the same Member State may defer compliance with the provisions of this Regulation until 1 July 1997.
Article 5
1. Member States shall comply with the provisions of paragraphs 13.2, 13.4 and 13.5 of the ISM Code as if the provisions thereof were mandatory, in relation to companies and ro-ro ferries.
2. For the purposes of paragraph 1, Member States may only authorize, or rely upon, fully or in part, a recognized organization.
For the purposes of paragraph 13.2 of the ISM Code, a Member State may only issue documents of compliance for a company which has its principal place of business on its own territory. Prior to such issue, the Member States shall consult the administration of the States whose flag the ro-ro ferries of that company are entitled to fly, if that administration is not that of the issuing Member State.
3. The document of compliance shall only be valid for five years from the date of its issue, provided always that a verification takes place once a year, in order to confirm the proper functioning of the safety management system, and to confirm that possible modifications introduced since the latest verification satisfy the provisions of the ISM Code.
4. The safety management certificate shall only be valid for five years from the date of its issue, provided always that an intermediate verification takes place at least every 30 months or more frequently in order to confirm the proper functioning of the safety management system and to confirm that possible modifications introduced since the latest verification satisfy the provisions of the ISM Code.
5. For the purposes of this Regulation, and in particular Article 6, each Member State shall accept a document of compliance or a safety management certificate issued by the administration of any other Member State or by a recognized organization acting on its behalf.
6. A Member State shall recognize the documents of compliance and safety management certificates issued by, or on behalf of, the administrations of third countries if it is satisfied that they demonstrate compliance with the provisions of this Regulation.
Documents of compliance and safety management certificates issued on behalf of administrations of third countries may only be recognized if they have been issued by a recognized organization.
Article 6
Member States shall satisfy themselves that all companies providing regular ro-ro ferry services to or from their ports comply with the provisions of this Regulation.
Article 7
Where a Member State considers that a company, notwithstanding the fact that it holds a document of compliance, cannot operate a ro-ro ferry on a regular service to or from its ports on the grounds that there is a risk of serious danger to safety of life or property, or the environment, the operation of such service may be suspended until such time as the danger is removed.
In the above circumstances the following procedure shall apply:
Article 8

COUNCIL DECISION of 25 June 1996 on improving Community agricultural statistics (96/411/EC)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 43 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2),
Having regard to Council Decision 93/464/EEC of 22 July 1993 on the framework programme for priority actions in the field of statistical information 1993 to 1997 (3), and in particular Article 4 (a) thereof,
Whereas the 1993-1997 framework programme envisaged by Decision 93/464/EEC establishes, inter alia, the need for better utilization of the resources devoted to agricultural statistics by implementation of the results of a 'screening` operation carried out under the previous statistical programme envisaged by the Council Resolution of 19 June 1989 on the implementation of a plan of priority actions in the field of statistical information: Statistical programme of the European Communities (1989 to 1992) (4);
Whereas this screening has identified the main aspects of the changes to be incorporated in Community agricultural statistics;
Whereas these changes include some of the main areas where savings may be made and where there are new or increasing needs; whereas these changes should conform to agreed general principles;
Whereas national adaptations have to be coordinated at Community level, in order to ensure that:
(a) data remain sufficiently reliable in the case of each Member State and comparable between Member States;
(b) the changes to Council legislation which may be necessary can be identified, prepared and proposed by the Commission in good time and in addition that the Commission approves implementing rules for Council legislation in good time;
(c) methodological studies by different Member States into efficient ways of meeting the new information needs are appropriate;
(d) the scheduling of national activities takes account of collective Community interest;
(e) the Community financial resources facilitating execution of this programme are used as an addition to other national resources and in the most efficient way;
Whereas the best means of achieving this coordination is within a formal structure which allows the technical constraints and preferences to be considered collectively and choices made which reconcile national and Community interests;
Whereas a financial contribution by the Community to the Member States is necessary, according to their objective needs, to facilitate the adaptations required;
Whereas, to achieve the desired savings, adaptations to the technical implementation of certain surveys may be necessary; whereas such adaptations should be permitted subject to appropriate safeguards;
Whereas provision should be made for a possible extension of this Decision in the context of the next framework programme for priority actions in the field of statistical information relating to the period after 1997;
Whereas the distribution of tasks between the Commission and the Member States is fully in accord with the principle of subsidiarity,
HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:

COMMISSION DECISION of 20 May 1996 concerning the placing on the market of genetically modified male sterile chicory (Cichorium intybus L.) with partial tolerance to the herbicide glufosinate ammonium pursuant to Council Directive 90/220/EEC (Text with EEA relevance) (96/424/EC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 90/220/EEC of 23 April 1990 on the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms (1), as last amended by Commission Directive 94/15/EC (2), and in particular Article 13 thereof,
Whereas, in accordance with Article 10 to 18 of Directive 90/220/EEC, there is a Community procedure enabling the competent authority of a Member State to give consent to the placing on the market of products consisting of genetically modified organisms;
Whereas, a notification concerning the placing on the market of such a product has been submitted to the competent authorities of a Member State (The Netherlands);
Whereas, the competent authority of the Netherlands has subsequently forwarded the dossier thereon to the Commission with a favourable opinion; whereas the competent authorities of other Member States have raised objections to the said dossier;
Whereas, therefore, in accordance with Article 13 (3), the Commission is required to take a decision in accordance with the procedure provided for in Article 21 of Directive 90/220/EEC;
Whereas, the Commission having examined each of the objections raised in light of the scope of Directive 90/220/EEC and the information submitted in the dossier has reached the following conclusions:
- there is no reason to believe that there will be any adverse effects from the transfer of the bar gene to wild chicory populations given the fact that such transfer could only confer a competitive or selective advantage to wild populations if the herbicide glufosinate-ammonium were the only means of controlling these populations, which is not the case,
- the consent to the placing on the market of the product should not cover its use as human food or animal feed since the submitted notification does not cover these aspects,
- there are no safety reasons for mentioning on the label that the product has been obtained by genetic modification techniques,
- since 50 % of the hybrid seeds are tolerant to the herbicide, the label should mention that the product may be tolerant to the herbicide glufosinate-ammonium, so that breeders become aware that it may not be possible to control volunteers by glufosinate ammonium;
Whereas the authorization of chemical herbicides applied to plants and the assessment of the impact of their use on human health and the environment falls within the scope of Council Directive 91/414/EEC of July 1991 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market (3), as last amended by Commission Directive 96/12/EC (4), and not within the scope of Directive 90/220/EEC;
Whereas Article 11 (6) and Article 16 (1) of the Directive provide additional safeguards if new information on risks of the product becomes available;
Whereas the measures provided for in this decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee of Member States representatives established under Article 21 of Directive 90/220/EEC,
HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:
Article 1
1. Without prejudice to other Community legislation and subject to the conditions outlined in paragraphs 2, 3 and 4, consent shall be given by the authorities of the Netherlands for the placing on the market of the following product, notified by Bejo-Zaden BV (Ref. C/NL/94/25), under Article 13 of Directive 90/220/EEC.
The product consists of seeds and plants derived from chicory (Cichorium intybus L. subspecies radicchio rosso) lines (RM3-3, RM3-4 and RM3-6) which have been transformed using Agrobacterium tumefaciens disarmed Ti-plasmid containing between the T-DNA borders:
(i) the barnase gene from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens (a ribonuclease) with the promoter PTA29 from Nicotiana tabacum and the terminator of the nopaline synthase gene from Agrobacterium tumefaciens;
(ii) the bar gene from Streptomyces hygroscopicus (a phosphinothricin acetyltransferase) with the promoter PSsuAra-tp from Arabidopsis thaliana and the TL-DNA gene 7 terminator from Agrobacterium tumefaciens;
(iii) the neo gene from Escherichia coli (a neomycin phosphotransferase II) with the promoter of the nopaline synthase gene from Agrobacterium tumefaciens and the octopine synthase gene terminator from Agrobacterium tumefaciens.
2. This consent covers any progeny derived from crosses of this product with any traditionally bred chicory.
3. The present consent covers the use of the product for breeding activities.
4. Without prejudice to labelling required by other Community legislation, it shall be indicated on the label of each package of seeds that the product:
- is to be used for breeding activities,
- and may be tolerant to the herbicide glufosinate ammonium.
Article 2
This Decision is addressed to the Member States.

COMMISSION DECISION of 14 October 1996 laying down special conditions governing the import of fishery and aquaculture products originating in the Ivory Coast (Text with EEA relevance) (96/609/EC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 91/493/EEC of 22 July 1991 laying down the health conditions for the production and the placing on the market of fishery products (1), as last amended by Directive 95/71/EC (2) are respected, and in particular Article 11 thereof,

COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 96/22/EC of 29 April 1996 concerning the prohibition on the use in stockfarming of certain substances having a hormonal or thyrostatic action and of beta-agonists, and repealing Directives 81/602/EEC, 88/146/EEC and 88/299/EEC
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 43 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),
(1) Whereas Directive 81/602/EEC (4) prohibits certain substances having a hormonal action and any substances having a thyrostatic action and whereas Directive 88/146/EEC (5) prohibits the use in stockfarming of certain substances having a hormonal action, whilst conceding derogations;
(2) Whereas Council Directive 88/299/EEC (6) lays down the conditions for applying the derogations provided for in Article 7 of Directive 88/146/EEC from the prohibition on trade in certain categories of animals and their meat;
(3) Whereas, on account of the residues they leave in meat and other foodstuffs of animal origin, certain substances having a thyrostatic, oestrogenic, androgenic or gestagenic action may be dangerous for consumers and may also affect the quality of foodstuffs of animal origin;
(4) Whereas new substances having an anabolizing action such as beta-agonists are used illegally in livestock-rearing with a view to stimulating the growth and yield of animals;
(5) Whereas the results of an enquiry conducted by the Commission in the Member States from 1990 to 1992 show that beta-agonists are widely available in the livestock-rearing sector, leading to their illegal use;
(6) Whereas the improper use of beta-agonists can be a serious risk to human health; whereas, in the interests of the consumer, the holding, administering to animals of any species and the placing on the market for that purpose of beta-agonists should be prohibited; whereas, moreover, the holding, administering to animals of any species and the placing on the market of stilbenes and thyrostatic substances should be prohibited and the use of other substances regulated;
(7) Whereas, however, the administering of medicinal products based on beta-agonists may be authorized for well-defined therapeutic purposes, in the case of certain categories of bovine animals, equidae and pets;
(8) Whereas, moreover, it is necessary to ensure that all consumers are able to acquire meat and foodstuffs derived therefrom under the same conditions of supply and that those products correspond as closely as possible to their concerns and expectations; whereas, given consumer sensitivity, this can only bring about an increase in the consumption of the products in question;
(9) Whereas the prohibition on the use of hormonal substances for fattening purposes should continue to apply; whereas the use of certain substances for therapeutic or zootechnical purposes may be authorized but must be strictly controlled in order to prevent any misuse;
(10) Whereas withdrawal periods are not harmonized at Community level and there are considerable differences between Member States, particularly as regards authorized veterinary medicinal products containing hormonal substances or beta-agonists; whereas, in the interests of harmonization, maximum withdrawal periods should therefore be set for such medicinal products;
(11) Whereas, furthermore, live animals so treated for therapeutic or zootechnical purposes and the meat from such animals should not as a general rule be traded, since this could impair the effectiveness of the control arrangements of the scheme as a whole; whereas, however, derogations from the prohibition may, subject to certain conditions, be provided for in respect of intra-Community trade and imports from third countries of animals intended for breeding and breeding animals at the end of their reproductive life;
(12) Whereas such derogations may be authorized where adequate guarantees are provided so as to prevent distortion of trade; whereas such guarantees must cover the products which may be used, the conditions governing their use and the checks to ensure that the conditions are complied with, particularly with regard to the necessary withdrawal period;
(13) Whereas provision should be made for the effective verification of application of the provisions deriving from this Directive;
(14) Whereas Directives 81/602/EEC, 88/146/EEC and 88/299/EEC should be repealed;
(15) Whereas, if the illegal use of growth and productivity promoters in stockfarming is to be combated effectively in all Member States, action will have to be organized at Community level;
(16) Whereas, on 18 January 1996, the European Parliament asked the Commission and the Council to continue opposing the importation into the Community of meat treated with hormones, requested the maintenance of the total ban on the use of growth promoters in stockfarming and, to that end, asked the Council to adopt without delay the Commission proposal on which the European Parliament had delivered its opinion on 19 April 1994,
HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:
Article 1
1. For the purposes of this Directive, the definitions of meat and meat products given in Directives 64/433/EEC (7), 71/118/EEC (8), 77/99/EEC (9), and 91/495/EEC (10), the definitions of aquaculture products given in Directive 91/493/EEC (11) and the definitions of veterinary medicinal products given in Directives 81/851/EEC (12) and 81/852/EEC (13) shall apply.

- for which no reagents or equipment exist for use in the analytical techniques for detecting the presence of residues in excess of the permitted limits,
(b) veterinary medicinal products containing beta-agonists which have a withdrawal period of more than 28 days after the end of treatment.
Article 7
1. For the purpose of trade, Member States may authorize the placing on the market of animals for breeding and breeding animals at the end of their reproductive life which, during the latter period, have undergone a treatment referred to in Articles 4 and 5 and may authorize the affixing of the Community stamp to meat from such animals where the conditions laid down in Articles 4 and 5 and the minimum withdrawal periods laid down in Article 6 (2), under (a) (ii) or (b) respectively or the withdrawal periods provided for in the authorization to place on the market are complied with.
However, trade in high-value horses, and in particular racehorses, competition horses, circus horses or horses intended for stud purposes or for exhibitions, including registered equidae to which veterinary medicinal products containing allyl trenbolone or beta-agonists have been administered for the purposes referred to in Article 4, may take place before the end of the withdrawal period, provided that the conditions governing administration are fulfilled and that the type and date of treatment are entered on the certificate or passport accompanying these animals.
2. Meat or products from animals to which substances having an oestrogenic, androgenic or gestagenic action or beta-agonists have been administered in accordance with the dispensatory provisions of this Directive may not be placed on the market for human consumption unless the animals in question have been treated with veterinary medicinal products complying with the requirements of Article 6 and in so far as the withdrawal period laid down was observed before the animals were slaughtered.
Article 8
Member States shall ensure that:
1. at the time of the import, manufacture, storage, distribution, sale and use of the substances referred to in Articles 2 and 3 (a), their possession is restricted to the persons authorized by national legislation in accordance with Article 1 of Directive 90/676EEC (15);
2. in addition to the checks provided for in the Directives governing the placing on the market of the various products in question, the official checks provided for in Article 11 of Directive 96/23/EC (16) are carried out by the competent national authorities without prior notice, with a view to ascertaining:
(a) the possession or presence of substances or products prohibited under Article 2, intended to be administered to animals for the purpose of fattening;
(b) the illegal treatment of animals;
(c) failure to observe the withdrawal periods provided for in Article 6;
(d) failure to observe the restrictions on the use of certain substances or products laid down in Articles 4 and 5;
3. the tests for the presence of:
(a) the substances referred to in point 1 in animals, in the drinking water of animals and in all places where animals are bred or kept;
4. where the checks provided for in points 2 and 3 reveal:
(a) the presence of substances or products the use or possession of which is prohibited, or the presence of residues of substances the administering of which comes under the heading of illegal treatment, such substances or products are confiscated, while any animals treated or the meat therefrom is placed under official supervision until the requisite penalties have been applied;
(b) failure to comply with the requirements of points 2 (b) and (c), the competent authority takes appropriate measures consistent with the gravity of the infringement.
Article 9
Without prejudice to Directive 81/851/EEC, undertakings buying or producing substances having a thyrostatic, oestrogenic, androgenic or gestagenic action and beta-agonists, undertakings authorized in any capacity to market such substances and undertakings buying or producing pharmaceutical and veterinary medicinal products from such substances shall be required to keep registers detailing, in chronological order, quantities produced or acquired and those sold or used for the production of pharmaceutical and veterinary medicinal products and the names of the persons to whom such quantities were sold or from whom they were purchased.

Article 15
COMMISSION DIRECTIVE 96/28/EC of 10 May 1996 adapting to technical progress Council Directive 76/116/EEC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to fertilizers (Text with EEA relevance)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 100a thereof,
Having regard to Council Directive 76/116/EEC of 18 December 1975 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to fertilizers (1), as last amended by Directive 89/530/EEC (2), and in particular Article 9 (1) thereof,
Whereas Article 7a of the Treaty envisages an area without internal frontiers in which the free circulation of goods, persons, services and capital is assured;
Whereas Directive 76/116/EEC laid down rules for the marketing of fertilizers within the internal market;
Whereas new fertilizers need to be added to Annex I to Directive 76/116/EEC to enable them to benefit from the Community marking provided for in Annex II to that Directive;
Whereas notice 94/C 138/04 (3) establishes a procedure that should be observed by any person (manufacturer or his representative) wanting to apply to a fertilizer the Community marking provided for in Annex II to Directive 76/116/EEC, by way of submitting a technical file to the Member State authorities which will act as rapporteur for the file to the Working Party on Fertilizers of the European Commission;
Whereas the measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee on the Adaptation to Technical Progress of the Directives for Removing Technical Barriers to trade in Fertilizers,
HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:
Article 1
Annex I to Directive 76/116/EEC shall be amended as follows:
1. The fertilizer included in Annex I to this Directive shall be added to Part A, point 1 entitled 'Nitrogenous fertilizers`
The following product and tolerance is added under A.1 in Annex III to Directive 76/116/EEC:

COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 96/42/EC of 25 June 1996 amending Directive 77/388/EEC on the common system of value added tax
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 99 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (1),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (2),
Whereas Article 12 (3) (d) of Directive 77/388/EEC (3) lays down that the rules concerning the taxation of agricultural outputs other than those falling within category 1 of Annex H are to be decided unanimously by the Council before 31 December 1994 on a proposal from the Commission; whereas, until that date, those Member States which had already been applying a reduced rate might continue to do so while those applying a standard rate could not apply a reduced rate; whereas that allowed a two-year postponement in the application of the standard rate;
Whereas experience has shown that the structural imbalance in the VAT rates applicable by Member States to agricultural outputs of the floricultural and horticultural sectors has led to reported cases of fraudulent activities; whereas that structural imbalance is a direct result of the application of Article 12 (3) (d) and should be redressed accordingly;
Whereas the most appropriate solution would be to extend to all Member States, on a transitional basis, the option of applying a reduced rate to supplies of agricultural outputs of the floricultural and horticultural sectors and of wood used as firewood,
HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:
Article 1
Directive 77/388/EEC is hereby amended as follows:
1. Article 12 (3) (d) shall be deleted;
2. the following shall be inserted in Article 28 (2):
'(i) Member States may apply a reduced rate to supplies of live plants (including bulbs, roots and the like, cut flowers and ornamental foliage) and wood for use as firewood.`
Article 2
Member States shall communicate to the Commission the text of the provisions of domestic law which they adopt in the field covered by this Directive.
Article 3
This Directive shall apply from 1 January 1995.
Article 4
This Directive is addressed to the Member States.
DIRECTIVE 96/57/EC OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 3 September 1996 on energy efficiency requirements for household electric refrigerators, freezers and combinations thereof
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 100a thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (2),
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 189b of the Treaty (3),
(1) Whereas it is important to promote measures aimed at the proper functioning of the internal market;
(2) Whereas in its resolution of 15 January 1985 on the improvement of energy-saving programmes in the Member States (4) the Council invited the Member States to pursue and where necessary increase their efforts to promote the more rational use of energy by the further development of integrated energy-saving policies;
(3) Whereas household refrigeration appliances account for a significant share of domestic electricity consumption in the Community and thus of total electricity consumption; whereas the various models of refrigeration appliances available on the Community market have very different levels of consumption for a given volume and similar features, i.e. extremely variable energy efficiency;
(4) Whereas some Member States are on the point of adopting provisions relating to the efficiency of household refrigerators and freezers, which might create barriers to trade in these products in the Community;
(5) Whereas it is appropriate to take as a base a high level of protection in proposals for the approximation of the provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action in Member States concerning health, safety, environmental protection and consumer protection; whereas this Directive ensures a high level of protection for both the environment and the consumer, in aiming at a significant improvement of the energy efficiency of these appliances;
(6) Whereas the adoption of such measures falls within Community competence; whereas the requirements of this Directive are within the limits of its objectives, thus conforming to the requirements of Article 3b of the Treaty;
(7) Whereas, moreover, Article 130r of the Treaty calls for the protection and improvement of the environment and the prudent and rational utilization of natural resources, these two objectives being among those of the Community policy on the environment; whereas electricity generation and consumption account for 30 % of man-made carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and some 35 % of primary energy consumption in the Community; whereas these percentages are increasing;
(8) Whereas, furthermore, Council Decision 89/364/EEC of 5 June 1989 on a Community action programme for improving the efficiency of electricity use (5) has as its twin objectives to encourage consumers to favour appliances and equipment with high electrical efficiency and to improve the efficiency of appliances and equipment;
(9) Whereas in its conclusions of 29 October 1990 the Council set an objective of stabilizing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in the Community at 1990 levels by the year 2 000; whereas in order to achieve this objective stronger measures are required to stabilize CO2 emissions within the Community;
(10) Whereas Decision 91/565/EEC (6) established a programme to promote energy efficiency in the Community (the SAVE programme);
(11) Whereas the energy efficiency measures incorporated in the most up-to-date models of refrigeration appliances available do not increase their production costs excessively and can pay for their initial cost through electricity savings within a few years or even more rapidly; whereas this calculation does not take into account the added benefit of the external costs of electricity generation thereby avoided, such as emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other pollutants;
(12) Whereas the 'natural` gain in energy efficiency due to market pressures and improved production processes, estimated at around 2 % per year, will contribute to efforts to achieve stricter energy consumption standards;
(13) Whereas Directive 92/75/EEC (7) (the framework Directive) and Commission Directive 94/2/EC (8) (the Directive implementing Directive 92/75/EEC), which require the compulsory labelling of appliances and an indication in other forms of the energy consumption, will increase consumers' awareness of the energy efficiency of household refrigeration appliances; whereas this measure will therefore also encourage the various competitors to offer levels of energy efficiency for their appliances higher than the standards required by this Directive; whereas, however, the provision of information to consumers must nevertheless be accompanied by an indication of the standards in order to achieve full benefit and lead to a real improvement in the total average efficiency of the appliances sold;
(14) Whereas this Directive, which is aimed at eliminating technical barriers with regard to improving the energy efficiency of household refrigeration appliances, must follow the 'new approach` established by the Council resolution of 7 May 1985 on a new approach to technical harmonization and standards (9) which specifically lays down that legislative harmonization is limited to the adoption, by means of directives, of the essential requirements with which products put on the market must conform;
(15) Whereas an effective enforcement system is necessary to ensure that the Directive is implemented properly, guarantee fair conditions of competition for producers and protect consumer rights;
(16) Whereas regard should be had to Council Decision 93/465/EEC of 22 July 1993 concerning the modules for the various phases of the conformity assessment procedures and the rules for the affixing and use of the CE conformity marking (10), which are intended to be used in the technical harmonization directives;
(17) Whereas in the interest of international trade, international standards should be used wherever appropriate; whereas the electricity consumption of a refrigeration appliance is defined by the European Committee for Standardization Standard EN 153 of July 1995 which is based on an international standard;
(18) Whereas household refrigeration appliances complying with the energy efficiency requirements of this Directive must bear the 'CE` marking and associated information, in order to enable them to move freely;
(19) Whereas this Directive is confined to household refrigeration appliances for foodstuffs, supplied by mains electricity, excluding those manufactured on a one-off basis; whereas refrigeration equipment for commercial use is much more varied and not appropriate for inclusion in this Directive,
HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:
Article 1
This Directive shall apply to new electric mains-operated household refrigerators, frozen food storage cabinets, food freezers, and combinations of these as defined in Annex I and referred to hereafter as 'refrigeration appliances`. Appliances which can also use other energy sources, particularly accumulators, and household refrigeration appliances working on the absorption principle and appliances manufactured on a one-off basis shall be excluded.
Article 2
1. Member States shall take all necessary measures to ensure that refrigeration appliances covered by this Directive can be placed on the Community market only if the electricity consumption of the appliance in question is less than or equal to the maximum allowable electricity consumption value for its category as calculated according to the procedures defined in Annex I.
2. The manufacturer of a refrigeration appliance covered by this Directive, his authorized representative established in the Community or the person responsible for placing the appliance on the Community market shall be responsible for ensuring that each appliance placed on the market conforms with the requirement referred to in paragraph 1.
Article 3
1. Member States may not prohibit, restrict or impede the placing on the market in their territory of refrigeration appliances which bear the 'CE` marking attesting to their conformity with all the provisions of this Directive.
2. Unless they have evidence to the contrary, Member States shall presume that refrigeration appliances bearing the 'CE` marking required under Article 5 comply with all the provisions of this Directive.
3. (a) Where refrigeration appliances are subject to other directives covering other aspects which also provide for affixing of the 'CE` marking, the latter shall indicate that the refrigeration appliances in question are also presumed, unless evidence to the contrary exists, to conform to the provisions of those other directives.
(b) However, where one or more of those directives allows the manufacturer, during a transitional period, to choose which rules to apply, the 'CE` marking shall indicate conformity solely with the provisions of those directives applied by the manufacturer. In that case, the reference numbers of the directives applied, as published in the Official Journal of the European Communities, must be given in the documents, notices or instructions accompanying the refrigeration appliances.
Article 4
The conformity assessment procedures and the obligations relating to the 'CE` marking of refrigeration appliances are laid down in Annex II.
Article 5
1. When appliances are placed on the market, they must bear the 'CE` marking, which shall consist of the initials 'CE`. The form of the marking to be used is shown in Annex III. The 'CE` marking shall be affixed visibly, legibly and indelibly to refrigeration appliances and, where appropriate, to the packaging.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 100a thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (2),
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 189b of the Treaty (3),
Whereas Council Directive 72/276/EEC of 17 July 1972 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to certain methods for the quantitative analysis of binary textile fibre mixtures (4) has been amended frequently and substantially; whereas, for reasons of clarity and rationality, the said Directive should be consolidated;
Whereas Directive 96/74/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 1996 on textile names (5) requires labelling to indicate the fibre composition of textile products, with checks being carried out by analysis on the conformity of these products with the indications given on the label;
Whereas the methods used for official tests carried out in the Member States to determine the fibre composition of textile products should be uniform, as regards both the pre-treatment of the sample and its quantitative analysis;
Whereas Directive 96/74/EC provides that the methods for sampling and analysis to be used in the Member States for the purpose of determining the fibre composition of products will be specified in separate directives; whereas therefore Annex II to this Directive lays down 15 uniform methods of analysis for most of the textile products composed of binary mixtures that are on the market;

COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 96/75/EC of 19 November 1996 on the systems of chartering and pricing in national and international inland waterway transport in the Community
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 75 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (2),
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 189c of the Treaty (3),
Whereas the growing problems of road and rail saturation, transport safety, environment, energy saving and quality of life of the citizen call, in the public interest, for greater development and better use of the transport potential offered by inland waterway, in particular by improving its competitiveness;
Whereas the difference in national laws on the systems for the commercial operation of inland waterway transport, does not make for the smooth functioning of the internal market in this sector; whereas, therefore, common provisions should be introduced at Community level for the whole of the inland waterways market, in accordance with the Council Resolution of 24 October 1994 on structural improvements in inland waterway transport (4);
Whereas the smooth functioning of the internal market calls for an adjustment in inland waterways transport to the organization of chartering by rotation, so as to move towards greater commercial flexibility and a system of freedom of chartering and pricing;
Whereas, to this end provision should be made for a transitional period, the scope of the rotation system being gradually limited for carriers to adapt to the conditions of a free market and, where appropriate, to set up trade groupings better suited to the logistical needs of shippers;
Whereas, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, it is both necessary and adequate to set a uniform timetable at Community level for the gradual liberalization of the market, while leaving with the Member States the responsibility for putting such liberalization into effect;
Whereas provisions must be adopted to allow action to be taken on the transport market in question in the event of a serious disturbance; whereas, to this end, the Commission should be given the power to take appropriate measures, in accordance with the procedure of an advisory committee,
HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:
Article 1
For the purposes of this Directive:
(a) 'system of chartering by rotation` shall mean a system which consists of allocating in a charter exchange requests for transport operations, at previously fixed prices and under conditions made known, from customers on the basis of the order in which vessels become available after unloading. Carriers are asked, in the order of their registration on the rota, to choose in turn a load from those on offer. Those who make no choice nonetheless keep their position in the order;
(b) 'carrier` shall mean an owner or an operator of one or more inland waterway vessels;
(c) 'competent authority` shall mean the authority appointed by the Member State to manage and organize the system of chartering by rotation;
(d) 'serious market disturbance` shall mean the emergence, in the inland waterway transport market, of problems specific to that market likely to cause a serious and potentially persistent excess of supply over demand, thereby posing a serious threat to the financial stability and survival of a large number of inland waterway carriers, unless the short and medium-term forecasts for the market in question indicate substantial and lasting improvements.
Article 2
In the field of national and international inland waterway transport in the Community, contracts shall be freely concluded between the parties concerned and prices freely negotiated.
Article 3
Notwithstanding Article 2, Member States may, for a transitional period up to 1 January 2000, maintain a system of minimum compulsory tariffs and systems of chartering by rotation, provided that:
- there is compliance with the conditions set out in Articles 4, 5 and 6; and
- the rotation and pricing systems imposed are freely accessible under the same conditions to all Member States' carriers.
Article 4
During the transitional period referred to in Article 3, the following shall not be subject to such systems of chartering by rotation:
(a) oil and gas, liquid cargo and dry bulk freight, special cargoes such as heavy and indivisible loads, container transport, transport within port areas, any kind of own-account transport and any type of transport operation already outside the system of chartering by rotation;
(b) loads which cannot be effectively dealt with by such systems, in particular:
- transport requiring goods handling equipment,
- combined transport, namely intermodal transport where the routes are principally by inland waterway and the initial and/or terminal legs (as short as possible) are by road or rail.
Article 5
During the transitional period referred to in Article 3, Member States shall take the necessary steps to maximize flexibility in the systems of chartering by rotation, in particular:
- by providing shippers with the opportunity of concluding contracts for multiple trips, i.e. a series of successive trips using the same vessel,
- by providing that single or multiple trips offered twice consecutively under the system of chartering by rotation without finding any takers shall be taken out of that system and be freely negotiated.
Article 6
Within a period of two years from the entry into force of this Directive, Member States involved in systems of chartering by rotation shall take the necessary measures to enable shippers to have a free choice between three types of contract:
- contracts on a time basis, including leasing contracts, where the carrier makes one or more vessels and crew exclusively available to a customer for a specific period for the transport of goods for that customer against payment of a given sum of money per day. The contract is freely concluded between the parties,
- tonnage contracts where the carrier undertakes to transport, for a period laid down in the contract, a given tonnage against payment of cargo rates by the tonne. The contract is freely concluded between the parties and must involve large consignments,
- contracts for single or multiple trips.
Article 7
1. In the event of a serious disturbance in the inland waterway transport market, the Commission may, without prejudice to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1101/89 of 27 April 1989 on structural improvements in inland waterway transport (5), at the request of a Member State, take suitable measures, and in particular measures designed to prevent any new increase in the transport capacity on offer on the market in question. The decision shall be taken in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 8 (2).
2. In the event of a request from a Member State for suitable measures, a decision shall be taken within a period of three months from receipt of the request.
3. The request from a Member State for suitable measures to be taken must be accompanied by all the information needed to assess the economic situation in the sector in question, in particular:
- indication of the average costs and prices for the different types of transport,
- the rate of utilization of the hold,
- forecast demand.
This information may be used only for statistical purposes. It may not be used for tax purposes or communicated to third parties.
4. Decisions taken pursuant to this Article, which may not exceed the duration of the disturbance in the market, shall be notified immediately to the Member States.
Article 8
1. The Commission shall be assisted by the Committee established by Directive 91/672/EEC (6).
2. The representative of the Commission shall submit to the Committee a draft of the measures to be taken. The Committee shall deliver its opinion on the draft, where necessary by vote, within a time limit which the Chairman may lay down according to the urgency of the matter.
The opinion shall be recorded in the minutes; in addition, each Member State shall have the right to ask to have its position recorded in the minutes.
The Commission shall take the utmost account of the opinion delivered by the Committee. It shall inform the Committee of the manner in which its opinion has been taken into account.
Article 9
1. Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive before 1 January 1997. They shall forthwith inform the Commission thereof.
When Member States adopt these measures, they shall contain a reference to this Directive or shall be accompanied by such reference at the time of their official publication. The procedure for such reference shall be adopted by Member States.
2. Member States shall forthwith communicate to the Commission the text of the provisions of national law which they adopt in the field covered by this Directive.

COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 569/96 of 29 March 1996 amending Regulations (EEC) No 1362/87 and (EEC) No 1158/91 as regards the buying-in and grant of aid for private storage of skimmed-milk powder, and Regulation (EEC) No 1756/93 fixing the operative events for the agricultural conversion rate applicable to milk and milk products
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 804/68 of 27 June 1968 on the common organization of the market in milk and milk products (1), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2931/95 (2), and in particular Articles 7 (5) and 28 thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 3813/92 of 28 December 1992 on the unit of account and the conversion rates to be applied for the purposes of the common agricultural policy (3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 150/95 (4), and in particular Article 6 (2) thereof,
Whereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 1014/68 of 20 July 1968 laying down general rules for the public storage of skimmed milk powder (5), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3577/90 (6), was repealed with effect from 1 March 1996 by Council Regulation (EC) No 1538/95 (7); whereas some of the rules in Regulation (EEC) No 1014/68 have been incorporated into Article 7 of Regulation (EEC) No 804/68, as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1538/95; whereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 625/78 of 30 March 1978 on detailed rules of application for public storage of skimmed-milk powder (8), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1802/95 (9), was re-cast when adjusted as a result of the repeal of Regulation (EEC) No 1014/68; whereas, consequently, Regulation (EEC) No 625/78 was also repealed with effect from 1 March 1996 by Commission Regulation (EC) No 322/96 of 22 February 1996 laying down detailed rules of application for the public storage of skimmed-milk powder (10);
Whereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1362/87 of 18 May 1987 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EEC) No 777/87 with respect to the buying-in and the granting of aid for the private storage of skimmed-milk powder (11), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1137/94 (12), Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1158/91 of 3 May 1991 on the buying in by tender of skimmed-milk powder to intervention agencies (13), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1802/95, and Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1756/93 (14), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 315/96 (15), make reference to Regulations (EEC) No 1014/68 and (EEC) No 625/78; whereas those references should be replaced by references to Regulation (EC) No 322/96; whereas, furthermore, Regulation (EEC) No 1158/91 should be amended to specify the way in which the buying-in price is to be calculated on the basis of the protein content of the skimmed-milk powder;
Whereas, in respect of the private storage scheme for skimmed milk powder, Article 5 of Regulation (EEC) No 1362/87 provides that, where skimmed-milk powder is for export, notwithstanding the rules normally applicable, the contractor may remove it from storage once a contractual thirty-day period has expired; whereas this derogation is hardly ever used and unnecessarily complicates the administration of the scheme; whereas it should therefore be abolished;
Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Milk and Milk Products,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
Regulation (EEC) No 1362/87 is amended as follows:

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81 of 30 June 1981 on the common organization of the markets in the sugar sector (1) as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1101/95 (2), and in particular Article 39 thereof,
Whereas Article 39 of Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81 requires the Member States and the Commission to communicate to each other the information necessary for the implementation of that Regulation; whereas implementing rules were laid down by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 787/83 of 29 March 1983 on communications in the sugar sector (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3819/85 (4); whereas, as a result of developments since then in the organization of the markets in the sugar sector, and in particular the commitments entered into by the Community under the Agreement on Agriculture concluded during the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations, those rules should be reviewed and new ones added and hence Regulation (EEC) No 787/83 should be repealed with effect from the start of the 1996/97 marketing year;
Whereas, if the situation with regard to sugar bought in or sold under the intervention measures provided for in Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81 is to be correctly assessed, relevant information must be available and in particular information on changes in the quantities held by intervention agencies and on the distribution of such quantities among warehouses approved pursuant to Article 1 (2) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 447/68 of 9 April 1968 laying down general rules for intervention buying of sugar (5), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1359/77 (6); whereas, if a close watch is to be kept on the implementation of the intervention system, it is also essential that information should be regularly made available on the quantities of sugar rendered unfit for human consumption and on the quantities used for the manufacture of certain chemical products, with an indication of the quantities of sugar which have been either denatured in accordance with one of the processes set out in the Annex to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 100/72 of 14 January 1972 laying down detailed rules for the denaturing of sugar for animal feed (7), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 260/96 (8), or used in the manufacture of the chemical products listed in the Annex to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1010/86 of 25 March 1986 laying down general rules for the production refund on certain sugar products used in the chemical industry (9), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1101/95, and those listed in the Annex to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1729/78 of 24 July 1978 laying down detailed rules of application in respect of the production refund for sugar used in the chemical industry (10), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 260/96;
Whereas the accurate and regular monitoring of trade with third countries is the only way to monitor developments closely in the light of the constraints arising from the Community's commitments under the aforementioned Agreement on Agriculture and to take, as appropriate, the measures required, in particular for the application of Article 23 (4a) of Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81, and those arising from the Community's commitments under the International Sugar Agreement; whereas the Commission should therefore receive on a regular basis the relevant information not only on imports and exports of products for which levies or refunds have been fixed, in respect of which operations licences are issued in particular under Commission Regulation (EC) No 1464/95 of 27 June 1995 on special detailed rules for application of the system of import and export licences in the sugar sector (11), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 2136/95 (12), regard being had to the more general provisions of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3719/88 (13), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2137/95 (14), and Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3665/87 (15), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1384/95 (16), but also on imports and exports of products exported without refund, with or without a licence, and in particular those covered by inward processing arrangements; whereas it should also be possible to monitor imports of preferential sugar to ensure the effective implementation of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2782/76 of 17 November 1976 laying down detailed implementing rules for the importation of preferential sugar (17), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1714/88 (18);
Whereas the effective administration of the quota system defined in Title III of Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81, particularly in view of the Community's commitments under the aforementioned Agreement on Agriculture, calls for an awareness of all the relevant factors; whereas this entails the application of Council Regulation (EEC) No 206/68 of 20 February 1968 laying down outline provisions for contracts and inter-trade agreements on the purchase of beet (19), as last amended by the Act of Accession of Austria, Finland and Sweden, Council Regulation (EEC) No 193/82 of 26 January 1982 laying down general rules for transfers of quotas in the sugar sector (20), Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2670/81 of 14 September 1981 laying down detailed implementing rules in respect of sugar production in excess of the quota (21), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 158/96 (22), and Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1443/82 of 8 June 1982 laying down detailed rules for the application of the quota system in the sugar sector (23), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 392/94 (24); whereas the above also applies to the equalization system for storage costs laid down by Article 8 of Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81; whereas this refers to the application of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1358/77 of 20 June 1977 laying down general rules for offsetting storage costs for sugar and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 750/68 (25), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3042/78 (26), and Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1998/78 of 18 August 1978 laying down detailed rules for the offsetting of storage costs for sugar (27), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1758/93 (28);
Whereas the persons concerned must have the assurance that the information on every undertaking will be treated as confidential;
Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Sugar,

COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 2214/96 of 20 November 1996 concerning harmonized indices of consumer prices: transmission and dissemination of sub-indices of the HICP (Text with EEA relevance)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2494/95 of 23 October 1995 concerning harmonized indices of consumer prices (1),
Whereas, by virtue of Article 5 (1) (b) of Regulation (EC) No 2494/95, each member State is required to produce a harmonized index of consumer prices (HICP) starting with the index for January 1997;

COMMISSION DECISION of 28 January 1997 establishing the identification system for packaging materials pursuant to European Parliament and Council Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste (Text with EEA relevance) (97/129/EC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to European Parliament and Council Directive 94/62/EC of 20 December 1994 on packaging and packaging waste (1), and in particular Article 8 (2) thereof,
Whereas the identification system is to be voluntary at least in a first stage but subject to revision to establish whether to introduce it on a binding basis at a further stage;
Whereas the identification system will be periodically reviewed and, if necessary, revised in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 21 of Directive 94/62/EC;
Whereas the measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee, established pursuant to Article 21 of Directive 94/62/EC,
HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:
Article 1
This Decision, which covers all packaging covered by Directive 94/62/EC aims to establish the numbering and abbreviations on which the identification system is based, indicating the nature of the packaging material(s) used and specifying which materials shall be subject to the identification system.
Article 2
For the purposes of this Decision:
- the same definitions set out in Article 3 of Directive 94/62/EC shall apply where relevant,
- composite: means packaging made up of different materials, and which cannot be separated by hand, none exceeding a given percent by weight which shall be established in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 21 of Directive 94/62/EC. Potential exemptions for some materials may be established by the same procedure.

COMMISSION DECISION of 12 February 1997 defining the treatment of the income of undertakings for collective investment (UCIs) for the purpose of the implementation of Council Directive 89/130/EEC, Euratom on the harmonization of the compilation of gross national product at market prices (Text with EEA relevance) (97/157/EC, Euratom)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 89/130/EEC, Euratom of 13 February 1989 on the harmonization of the compilation of gross national product at market prices (1),
Whereas for the purpose of the definition of gross national product at market prices (GNPmp) pursuant to Article 1 of Directive 89/130/EEC, Euratom, which, in virtue of Article 8 (1) of Council Regulation (EC) No 2223/96 of 25 June 1996 on the European system of national and regional accounts in the Community (2), is applicable while Decision 94/728/EC, Euratom (3) remains in force, it is necessary to clarify the treatment of the income of undertakings for collective investment (UCIs) according to the European system of integrated economic accounts (ESA) in force;
Whereas the ESA second edition does not contain explicit provisions for the recording of the income of UCIs, in particular their undistributed income;
Whereas it is therefore necessary to interpret the rules of the ESA second edition, according to these underlying principles, in order to indicate a method of recording this income;
Whereas the measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established by Article 6 of Directive 89/130/EEC, Euratom,
HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:
Article 1
For the purpose of the implementation of Directive 89/130/EEC, Euratom, the UCIs' income consists of the interest received on the deposits and other investments acquired on the one hand, and of the dividends earned on the shares held by the UCIs, on the other. These interest and dividends may be paid out to investors, or added to the capital.
When distributed, this income is recorded in the Distribution of income account of the shareholders, within property and entrepreneurial income (Code R40 of the ESA, currently in force).
When this income is not distributed, it must be treated as an income paid out by the UCI to its shareholders, which the latter reinvest immediately in the UCI. This means that this income must be recorded within property and entrepreneurial income like in the case of distributed income. Moreover, the same amount will be classified as part of shares, in the Financial account of the shareholders.
Article 2
This Decision is addressed to the Member States.
COMMISSION DECISION of 17 February 1997 on the procedure for attesting the conformity of construction products pursuant to Article 20 (2) of Council Directive 89/106/EEC as regards structural timber products and ancillaries (Text with EEA relevance) (97/176/EC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 89/106/EEC of 21 December 1988 on the approximation of laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States relating to construction products (1), as amended by Directive 93/68/EEC (2), and in particular Article 13 (4) thereof,
Whereas the Commission is required to select, as between the two procedures in accordance with Article 13 (3) of Directive 89/106/EEC for attesting the conformity of a product, the 'least onerous possible procedure consistent with safety`; whereas this means that it is necessary to decide whether, for a given product or family of products, the existence of a factory production control system under the responsibility of the manufacturer is a necessary and sufficient condition for an attestation of conformity, or whether, for reasons related to compliance with the criteria mentioned in Article 13 (4), the intervention of an approved certification body is required for that purpose;
Whereas Article 13 (4) requires that the procedure thus determined must be indicated in the mandates and in the technical specifications; whereas, therefore, it is desirable to define the concept of products or family of products as used in the mandates and in the technical specifications;
Whereas the two procedures provided for in Article 13 (3) are described in detail in Annex III to Directive 89/106/EEC; whereas it is necessary therefore to specify clearly the methods by which the two procedures must be implemented, by reference to Annex III, for each product or family of products, since Annex III gives preference to certain systems;
Whereas the procedure referred to in point (a) of Article 13 (3) corresponds to the systems set out in the first possibility, without continuous surveillance, and the second and third possibilities of point (ii) of Section 2 of Annex III, and the procedure referred to in point (b) of Article 13 (3) corresponds to the systems set out in point (i) of Section 2 of Annex III, and in the first possibility, with continuous surveillance, of point (ii) of Section 2 of Annex III;
Whereas the measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Construction,
HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:
Article 1
The products and families of products set out in Annex I shall have their conformity attested by a procedure whereby the manufacturer has under its sole responsibility a factory production control system ensuring that the product in is conformity with the relevant technical specifications.
Article 2
The products set out in Annex II shall have their conformity attested by a procedure whereby, in addition to a factory production control system operated by the manufacturer, an approved certification body is involved in assessment and surveillance of the production control or of the product itself.
Article 3
The procedure for attesting conformity as set out in Annex III shall be indicated in mandates for harmonized standards.
Article 4
This Decision is addressed to the Member States.

COMMISSION DECISION of 11 December 1997 repealing Commission Decision 97/613/EC and imposing special conditions on the import of pistachios and certain products derived from pistachios originating in, or consigned from Iran (Text with EEA relevance) (97/830/EC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,

Having regard to Council Directive 93/43/EEC of 14 June 1993 on the hygiene of foodstuffs (1) and in particular Article 10 (1) thereof,
Whereas Commission Decision 97/613/EC of 8 September 1997 on the temporary suspension of imports of pistachios and certain products derived from pistachios originating in, or consigned from Iran (2) is applicable until 15 December 1997 and should be repealed;
Whereas pistachios originating in, or consigned from Iran have been found to be, in many cases, contaminated with excessive levels of Aflatoxin B1;
Whereas the Scientific Committee for Food has noted that Aflatoxin B1, even at extremely low doses, causes cancer of the liver and in addition is genotoxic;
Whereas this constitutes a serious threat to public health within the Community and it is imperative to adopt protective measures at Community level;
Whereas an examination of conditions of hygiene in Iran has been undertaken and revealed that improvements in hygiene practices and the traceability of pistachios are required; whereas the mission team was unable to check all stages of the handling of pistachios prior to exportation; whereas commitments have been received from the Iranian Authorities in particular in relation to improvements in production, handling, sorting, processing, packaging and transport practices; whereas it is therefore appropriate to subject pistachios or products derived from pistachios originating in, or consigned from Iran to special conditions to provide a high level of protection to public health;
Whereas pistachios and products derived from pistachios originating in, or consigned from Iran, may be imported, provided that these special conditions are applied;
Whereas it is necessary that pistachios and products derived from pistachios have been produced, sorted, handled, processed, packaged and transported following good hygienic practices; whereas it is necessary to establish the levels of Aflatoxin B1 and total Aflatoxin in samples taken from the consignment immediately prior to leaving Iran;
Whereas it is necessary for documentary evidence to be provided by the Iranian Authorities to accompany each consignment of pistachios originating in, or consigned from Iran, relating to the conditions of production, sorting, handling, processing, packaging and transport and the results of laboratory analysis of the consignment for levels of Aflatoxin B1 and total Aflatoxin;
Whereas, it is necessary to submit for analyses lots of pistachios originating in, or consigned from all third countries, in order to determine the levels of contamination of pistachios from all sources with Aflatoxin B1 and total Aflatoxin, whereas co-ordinated official control programmes for foodstuffs shall be completed to this end;
Whereas Member States have been consulted on 29 October 1997 and on 10 November 1997,
HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:
Article 1
This Decision repeals Decision 97/613/EC of 8 September 1997 on the temporary suspension of imports of pistachios and products derived from pistachios originating in, or consigned from Iran.

2. Pistachios and products derived from pistachios originating in, or consigned from Iran, may only be imported into the Community through one of the points of entry listed in Annex II.
3. Each consignment shall be identified with a code which corresponds to the code on the sampling results of the official sampling and analysis and health certificate referred to in paragraph 1.
4. The competent authorities in each Member State shall ensure that imported pistachios originating in, or consigned from Iran, are subject to documentary checks to ensure that the requirement for the health certificate and sampling results referred to in paragraph 1, are complied with.
5. The competent authority shall ensure that before release onto the market from the point of entry into the Community, each consignment is subject to systematic sampling and analysis for Aflatoxin B1 and total Aflatoxin. The Commission shall be informed by the competent authority of the results of these analyses.
Article 3
The present Decision shall be reviewed before the 31 October, 1998, in order to assess whether the special conditions referred to in Article 2 provide a sufficient level of protection to public health within the Community. The review shall also assess whether there is a continuing need for the special conditions.

(2) Whereas Directives 92/50/EEC (5), 93/36/EEC (6) and 93/37/EEC (7) coordinated the national procedures relating to public service, public supply and public works contracts respectively, in order to introduce equal conditions of competition for such contracts in all the Member States;

(4) Whereas, in view of the international rights and commitments devolving on the Community as a result of the acceptance of the Agreement, the arrangements to be applied to tenderers and products from signatory third countries are those defined by the Agreement, the scope of which does not, in the case of Directive 92/50/EEC, include service contracts listed in Annex I B thereto, R& D service contracts mentioned in category 8 of Annex I A thereto, telecommunications service contracts mentioned in category 5 of Annex I A thereto, whose CPC numbers are 7524, 7525 and 7526, and financial service contracts mentioned in category 6 of Annex I A thereto in connection with the issue, sale, purchase or transfer of securities or other financial instruments, and central bank services;

COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 142/97 of 27 January 1997 concerning the delivery of information about certain existing substances as foreseen under Council Regulation (EEC) No 793/93 (Text with EEA relevance)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 793/93 of 23 March 1993 on the evaluation and control of the risks of existing substances (1), and in particular Article 12 (2) thereof,
Whereas the Commission needs relevant information on certain substances in order to initiate the review procedure under Articles 69, 84 and 112 of the Accession Treaty of provisions not yet applicable in the new Member States, whereas this information must be available before all the information required by Articles 3 and 4 of Regulation (EEC) No 793/93 is available;

COUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 552/97 of 24 March 1997 temporarily withdrawing access to generalized tariff preferences from the Union of Myanmar
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 3281/94 of 19 December 1994 applying a four-year scheme of generalized tariff preferences (1995 to 1998) in respect of certain industrial products originating in developing countries (1), and in particular Article 12 (3) thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1256/96 of 20 June 1996 applying multiannual schemes of generalized tariff preferences from 1 July 1996 to 30 June 1999 in respect of certain agricultural products originating in developing countries (2), and in particular Article 12 (3) thereof,
Having regard to the proposals from the Commission (3),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (4),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (5),
Whereas pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 3281/94 and Regulation (EC) No 1256/96 the Union of Myanmar (hereafter referred to as 'Myanmar`) is a beneficiary of generalized tariff preferences;
Whereas Article 9 of Regulation (EC) No 3281/94 and Article 9 of Regulation (EC) No 1256/96 provide that the preferences in question may be temporarily withdrawn in whole or in part in circumstances including the practice of any form of forced labour as defined in the Geneva Conventions of 25 September 1926 and 7 September 1956 and International Labour Organization (ILO) Conventions Nos 29 and 105;
Whereas on 7 June 1995 the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) and the European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC) made a joint complaint to the Commission under Article 9 of Regulation (EC) No 3281/94 and called for Myanmar to be temporarily withdrawn from the Community scheme of generalized tariff preferences because of its use of forced labour;
Whereas on 2 January 1997 the ICFTU and the ETUC notified the Commission that they were extending the scope of the joint complaint lodged under Regulation (EC) No 3281/94, with a view to obtaining the withdrawal of Myanmar's preferential entitlement also under Regulation (EC) No 1256/96;
Whereas the Commission examined the complaint of 7 June 1995 in consultation with the Generalized Preferences Committee; whereas the evidence put forward by the complainants was judged sufficient to justify the opening of an investigation, and whereas the Commission decided by a Notice of 16 January 1996 (6) that an investigation should take place;
Whereas the Myanmar authorities were formally notified of the opening of the investigation; whereas they denied that the practices referred to in the complaint constituted forced labour, citing the exceptions in Article 2 (2) of ILO Convention No 29, and claiming that those exceptions covered the 1907 Town Act and the 1908 Village Act, which allow the population to be made to carry out works and services; whereas that interpretation has been challenged by the ILO, whose competent bodies have called for the immediate repeal of the laws in question in order to ensure compliance with the letter and the spirit of Convention No 29;
Whereas the written and oral statements collected by the Commission during the course of the investigation conducted in consultation with the Generalized Preferences Committee corroborate the allegations contained in the complaint; whereas it has emerged that the authorities in Myanmar have routinely used forced labour, not only for military operations but also for civilian and military infrastructure building projects, backed by coercion and frequently violent reprisals;
Whereas, seeking to add to the information it had gathered during the investigation, the Commission requested the authorities of Myanmar to cooperate with that investigation by allowing a fact-finding team into the country; whereas this request was denied and since the conditions in Article 11 (5) of Regulation (EC) No 3281/94 are thus fulfilled the findings of the investigation could be based on the information available;
Whereas the evidence gathered during the Commission's investigation of the initial complaint by the ICFTU and ETUC and the resulting conclusions are broad enough in scope to provide a valid basis for examining the extended complaint lodged by those organizations on 2 January 1997, thus rendering a specific investigation of the agricultural sector unnecessary; whereas the requirements of Article 9 (2) of Regulation (EC) No 1256/96 have thus been met and the conditions laid down in Article 11 (5) of that Regulation have been fulfilled;
Whereas the information available thus provides sufficient grounds to conclude that withdrawal of Myanmar's access to the scheme of generalized preferences for which it is eligible is justified;
Whereas the findings of the investigation have been reported to the Generalized Preferences Committee in accordance with Article 12 (1) of Regulation (EC) No 3281/94;
Whereas the fact that the practices condemned have been routine and widespread means that a complete withdrawal of access to the arrangements is warranted;
Whereas in the light of the foregoing, the generalized tariff preferences applicable to industrial and agricultural products originating in Myanmar should be temporarily withdrawn until it has been established that the practices in question have been brought to an end;
Whereas goods in shipment to the European Community should be excluded from this withdrawal of preferences, provided that they were dispatched before the date of entry into force of this Regulation,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
The Union of Myanmar's access to the tariff preferences granted by Regulation (EC) No 3281/94 and Regulation (EC) No 1256/96 is hereby temporarily withdrawn.
Article 2
The Council, acting by qualified majority, on a proposal from the Commission, shall bring the application of this Regulation to an end in the light of a Commission report on forced labour in Myanmar, showing that the practices mentioned in Article 9 (1), first indent of Regulation (EC) No 3281/94 and Article 9 (1), first indent of Regulation (EC) No 1256/96 which have caused the withdrawal of access to generalized tariff preferences from Myanmar no longer exist.
Article 3
This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.

Whereas, to prevent irregularities in applying the scheme and to ensure its transparency, the producer organizations must notify the responsible monitoring authorities in advance of each withdrawal; whereas, in the absence of this notification, the product can be disposed of only after authorization from the Member State; whereas, furthermore, a communications system for the producer organizations and the Member States should be set up;
Whereas, for the implementation of Article 25 of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96, the time limits should be laid down for presenting the measures taken by the Member States to ensure environmentally sound practice in the withdrawal operations;

Whereas it is necessary to repeal Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3587/86 (3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1363/95 (4), Commission Regulation (EEC) No 827/90 (5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 771/95 (6), Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2103/90 (7), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1363/95, Regulation (EEC) No 2276/92 (8), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1363/95, and Commission Regulation (EC) No 113/97 (9), whose provisions have become obsolete or are to be replaced by this Regulation;

Whereas the Management Committee for Beef and Veal has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its chairman,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
1. The price to be paid to producers or their agents by the United Kingdom competent authority pursuant to Article 1 (1) shall be:
- ECU 0,8 per kilogram live weight for cows,
- ECU 0,9 per kilogram live weight for other animals.
No payment shall be made for weights in excess of 560 kilograms live weight, calculated where necessary using the coefficients referred to in paragraph 2.
2. Where it is necessary to weigh the animal concerned after slaughter, in order to calculate what the live weight would have been, the dead weight after bleeding and removal of the hide, head, feet and viscera shall be multiplied by a coefficient of:
- 2 in the case of cows,
- 1,70 in the case of all other animals.
3. The Community shall co-finance the expenditure incurred by the United Kingdom for the purchases referred to under Article 1 (1) at a rate of ECU 291 per head in the case of cows and ECU 328 per head in the case of animals other than cows for each purchased animal destroyed in accordance with the provisions of Article 1.

Should this undertaking not be given, the amount of the price to be paid in accordance with paragraph 1 for the animal in question shall be reduced by an amount equal to the applicable amount of the deseasonalization premium. Should an application for this premium be presented for this animal, the producer concerned shall be obliged to refund out of the price received for the animal an amount equal to the applicable deseasonalization premium. In these two cases, the rate of the Community contribution provided for in paragraph 3 shall be reduced by an amount equal to the applicable deseasonalization premium.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 130w thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 189c of the Treaty (2),
Whereas the impact on the structures of a developing society of an economy based on the production of drugs, or which derives a substantial revenue from them, undermines a country's smooth integration into the world economy;
Whereas the breakdown of social structures in developing countries due to drug consumption and the related industry is detrimental to sustainable social development and the attainment of the goals of Community policy in the sphere of development cooperation as defined in Article 130u of the Treaty;
Whereas as part of the effort to combat the supply of drugs it is essential, in particular, to effect a radical reduction of poverty in the south and to offer the population a lawful alternative to the growing of illegal crops;
Whereas institutional support should be given to those developing countries which so request so that they can combat drugs more effectively;
Whereas in a communication to the Parliament and to the Council dated 23 June 1994, the Commission presented its guidelines for a European Union plan of action on drugs for 1995-1999, including measures at international level;
Whereas Parliament stated its views on the guidelines in its Opinion on the communication, adopted on 15 June 1995;
Whereas the Fourth ACP-EC Convention and the cooperation, association and partnership agreements concluded by the European Community with developing countries contain clauses on cooperation to curb drug abuse and drug trafficking, the monitoring of trade in precursors, chemical products and psychotropic substances and the exchange of relevant information, including measures in the field of money laundering; whereas there is a relationship between the campaign against drugs and drug addiction and the aims of the cooperation policy pursued by the Community and its developing-country partners;
Whereas the international community's strategy to curb drug abuse and drug trafficking is based on universal accession to the Single Convention on narcotic drugs of 1961, as amended by the Protocol of 1972, the Convention on psychotropic substances of 1971 and the International Convention against illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances of 1988, and on the systematic implementation of those conventions at national and international level;
Whereas the European Community is a party to the Convention of 1988, in particular by virtue of Article 12 of that Convention, and has adopted Community legislation based on the recommendations of the Chemicals Action Task Force set up by the G7 and the President of the Commission in 1989, the effectiveness of which would be generally enhanced by the adoption of the relevant legislation and procedures in other parts of the world;
Whereas effective action against drugs must also encompass measures against the laundering of money from drug trafficking, such as the adoption of a suitable legal framework and appropriate mechanisms in the countries concerned;
Whereas human rights must be duly respected in implementing measures under this Regulation;
Whereas the Member States of the European Community have endorsed the policy statement and general plan of action adopted by the UN General Assembly at its 17th special session;
Whereas a financial reference amount within the meaning of point 2 of the Declaration by the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission of 6 March 1995 is included in this Regulation for the period 1998-2000, without thereby affecting the powers of the budgetary authority as they are defined by the Treaty,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
In the framework of its development cooperation policy and taking account of the harmful effects on development efforts of the production, trading and consumption of drugs, the Community shall carry out cooperation activities in the field of drugs and drug addiction in developing countries, giving priority to those which have demonstrated political will at the highest level to solve their drug problem. The existence of such will may be demonstrated inter alia by ratification of the Single Convention of 1961 as amended by the Protocol of 1972, the Convention of 1971 and the Convention of 1988. Commitment on the part of developing countries shall take the form, inter alia, of the implementation of domestic legislation against laundering of money generated through illicit drugs.
Article 2
The assistance provided under this Regulation shall complement and reinforce assistance provided under other instruments of development cooperation.
Article 3
The Community shall give priority at the request of a partner country to supporting the preparation of a national drug control master plan, in close consultation with the United Nations International Drug Control Programme (UNDCP). These plans will identify objectives, strategies and priorities in the campaign against drugs and the related resource requirements (including financial requirements), thus establishing an integrated, multidisciplinary and multisectoral approach designed to maximize the efficiency of national drug control programmes and international assistance.
The prevention of drug addiction, together with demand reduction, shall be addressed in a consistent policy comprising education and objective information about the consequences of addiction, targeted especially at young people.
Community cooperation shall take place in a spirit of dialogue reflecting the genuine cultural differences which affect the perception of drug-related problems, this being crucial to ensure the social and political viability of drug control strategies.
Article 4
Preferably operating within the strategic framework established by the national plans, the Community shall also support specific operations capable of a measurable impact (i.e. effective and tangible results within a time-limit set in advance) in the following areas:
- development of institutional capacity, in particular for the implementation of:
- National Drug Control Plans by developing countries,
- agreements between the Community and certain developing countries, in particular to combat the diversion of chemical precursors and to curb money laundering,
- demand reduction, in particular through analysis of local patterns, the introduction of measures to control trade in and consumption of narcotics and psychotropic substances, treatment and reintegration of drug addicts, as well as risk limitation. These measures must be integrated into policies on health and education, development and combating poverty and social and economic exclusion,
- promotion of pilot alternative development projects, conceived as a process by which the production of illicit drug crops is eventually both combatted and eliminated through appropriate rural development measures in the context of sustained national economic growth. These projects shall comprise social and economic measures which take into account factors contributing to illicit production as well as measures which may facilitate improved use of commercial preferences. In this connection, it shall be systematically examined whether it is possible to make more use of other Community financial instruments (e.g. ALA) and the European Development Fund for alternative development projects,
- financing of studies, seminars and fora for the exchange of experience in the above fields.
Particular attention shall be paid to the participation of local people and target groups in identifying, planning and carrying out operations.
The Community shall only finance projects in which respect for human rights is guaranteed.

Article 6
1. The instruments to be employed in the course of the operations referred to in Articles 3 and 4 shall include studies, technical assistance, training or other services, supplies and works, along with audits and evaluation and monitoring missions.
2. According to the needs of the operations concerned, Community financing may cover both capital investment, other than the purchase of real estate, and operating costs in foreign or local currency. However, with the exception of training programmes, operating costs may normally be covered only during the start-up phase and on a degressive basis.
3. A financial contribution from the partners defined in Article 5 shall be sought for each cooperation operation. Their contribution will be requested within the limits of the possibilities available to the parties concerned and depending on the nature of the operation concerned.
4. A financial contribution from the local partners, particularly in respect of operating costs, shall be sought as a matter of priority in the case of projects intended to launch long term activities, so as to ensure the viability of such projects once Community funding comes to an end.
5. Opportunities may be sought for cofinancing with other fund providers, and especially with Member States.
6. The Commission will ensure that the Community character of the aid provided under this Regulation is highlighted.
7. In order to achieve the objectives of consistency and complementarity referred to in the Treaty and with the aim of guaranteeing optimum effectiveness of all these operations, the Commission may take all necessary coordination measures, including in particular:
(a) a system for the systematic exchange and analysis of information on operations financed and those which the Community and the Member States propose to finance;
(b) on-the-spot coordination of the implementation of operations through regular meetings and exchange of information between representatives of the Commission and of the Member States in the beneficiary country.
8.

- cultural, social, gender and environmental aspects,
- institutional development necessary to achieve project goals,
- experience gained from operations of the same kind.

(4) Whereas it seems appropriate that the measures provided for in this Directive should not go beyond what is necessary to achieve the objective of the harmonisation necessary to ensure that export policy is based on uniform principles and that competition between enterprises in the Community is not distorted;
(5) Whereas in order to lessen existing distorsions of competition, it is desirable that the different official export credit insurance systems be harmonised, as envisaged in Article 112 of the Treaty, on the basis of uniform principles and in such a way as to form an integral part of the common commercial policy;
(6) Whereas the provision by governments (or special institutions controlled by governments) of export credit guarantee or insurance programmes at premium rates which are inadequate to cover the long-term operating costs and losses of the programmes are classified as prohibited export subsidies in the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures concluded in the framework of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations (1986 to 1994) (1), in particular under Article 3(1)(a) and paragraph (j) of Annex I thereto;
(7) Whereas the premium charged by credit insurers should correspond to the risk insured;
(8) Whereas harmonisation would foster cooperation among the credit insurers acting on behalf of the State or with State support, and enhance cooperation among enterprises within the Community as envisaged by Article 130 of the Treaty;
(9) Whereas both harmonisation and cooperation are major and crucial factors in the competitiveness of Community exporters on non-Community markets;
(10) Whereas the Commission White Paper on completing the internal market adopted by the European Council in June 1985 stresses the importance of an environment conducive to cooperation among enterprises in the Community;
(11) Whereas, by a Decision (2) dated 27 September 1960, the Council set up a Policy Coordination Group for Credit Insurance, Credit Guarantees and Financial Credits;
(12) Whereas on 15 May 1991 the said Policy Coordination Group mandated experts from each of the Member States at that time who, as the Single Market 1992 Experts' Group, submitted reports containing a set of proposals on 27 March 1992, 11 June 1993 and 9 February 1994;
(13) Whereas by Decision 93/112/EEC (3), the Council implemented into Community law the OECD Arrangement on Guidelines for Officially Supported Export Credits;
(14) Whereas Council Directive 70/509/EEC of 27 October 1970 on the adoption of a common credit insurance policy for medium- and long-term transactions with public buyers (4) and Council Directive 70/510/EEC of 27 October 1970 on the adoption of a common credit insurance policy for medium and long-term transactions with private buyers (5), should be replaced by this Directive;
(15) Whereas this initial harmonisation of export credit insurance should be considered as a step towards convergence of the various systems of the Member States,
HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:

Entry into force
COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 98/49/EC of 29 June 1998 on safeguarding the supplementary pension rights of employed and self-employed persons moving within the Community
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Articles 51 and 235 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),
(1) Whereas one of the fundamental freedoms of the Community is the free movement of persons; whereas the Treaty provides that the Council shall, acting unanimously, adopt such measures in the field of social security as are necessary to provide freedom of movement of workers;
(2) Whereas the social protection of workers is ensured by statutory social security schemes complemented by supplementary social security schemes;
(3) Whereas the legislation already adopted by the Council with a view to protecting the social security rights of workers moving within the Community and of members of their family, namely Council Regulations (EEC) No 1408/71 of 14 June 1971 on the application of social security schemes to employed persons, to self-employed persons and to members of their families moving within the Community (4) and (EEC) No 574/72 of 21 March 1972 laying down the procedure for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 on the application of social security schemes to employed persons, to self-employed persons and to members of their families moving within the Community (5), concern only statutory pension schemes; whereas the system of coordination provided for in those Regulations does not extend to supplementary pension schemes, except for schemes which are covered by the term 'legislation` as defined by the first subparagraph of Article 1(j) of Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 or in respect of which a Member State makes a declaration under that Article;
(4) Whereas the Council has a wide discretion regarding the choice of the most appropriate measures for attaining the objective of Article 51 of the Treaty; and whereas the system of coordination provided for in Regulations (EEC) No 1408/71 and (EEC) No 574/72, and in particular the rules of aggregation, are not appropriate to supplementary pension schemes, except for schemes which are covered by the term 'legislation` as defined by the first subparagraph of Article 1(j) of Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 or in respect of which a Member State makes a declaration under that Article, and should therefore be subject to specific measures, of which this Directive is the first, in order to take account of their special nature and characteristics and the diversity of such schemes within and between Member States;
(5) Whereas no pension or benefit should be subject to both the provisions of this Directive and those of Regulations (EEC) No 1408/71 and (EEC) No 574/72, and therefore any supplementary pension scheme which comes within the scope of those Regulations, because a Member State has made a declaration to that effect under Article 1(j) of Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71, cannot be subject to the provisions of this Directive;
(6) Whereas in its Recommendation 92/442/EEC of 27 July 1992 on the convergence of social protection objectives and policies (6) the Council recommended that Member States should 'promote, where necessary, changes to the conditions governing the acquisition of pension and, especially, supplementary pension rights with a view to eliminating obstacles to the mobility of employed workers`;
(7) Whereas a contribution to this objective can be made if workers who move or whose place of employment moves from one Member State to another are guaranteed equal treatment as regards the protection of their supplementary pension rights with workers who remain or whose place of employment changes but remains within the same Member State;
(8) Whereas freedom of movement for persons, which is one of the basic rights enshrined in the Treaty, is not confined to employed persons but also extends to self-employed persons;
(9) Whereas the Treaty does not provide powers other than those of Article 235 to take appropriate measures within the field of social security for self-employed persons;
(10) Whereas, in order to enable the right of free movement to be exercised effectively, workers and others holding entitlement should have certain guarantees for equal treatment regarding the preservation of their vested pension rights deriving from supplementary pension schemes;
(11) Whereas the Member States should take the necessary measures to ensure that benefits under supplementary pension schemes are paid to members and former members thereof as well as others holding entitlement under such schemes in all Member States, given that all restrictions on the free movement of payments and capital are prohibited under Article 73b of the Treaty;
(12) Whereas in order to facilitate the exercise of the right to free movement, national regulations should, where necessary, be adjusted in order to enable contributions to continue to be made to a supplementary pension scheme established in one Member State by or on behalf of workers who are posted to another Member State in accordance with Title II of Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71;
(13) Whereas in this regard the Treaty requires not only the abolition of any discrimination based on nationality between workers of the Member States but also the elimination of any national measure likely to impede or render less attractive for those workers the exercise of the fundamental freedoms guaranteed by the Treaty as interpreted by the Court of Justice of the European Communities in successive judgments;
(14) Whereas workers exercising their right to free movement should be adequately informed by employers, trustees or others responsible for the management of supplementary pension schemes, particularly with regard to the choices and alternatives available to them;
(15) Whereas this Directive is without prejudice to the laws of the Member States concerning collective action to defend the interests of trades and professions;
(16) Whereas, by reason of the diversity of supplementary social security schemes, the Community should lay down only a general framework of objectives and therefore a Directive is the appropriate legal instrument;
(17) Whereas, in accordance with the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality as set out in Article 3b of the Treaty, the objectives of this Directive cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore be better achieved by the Community; whereas this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve those objectives,
HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:
CHAPTER I
OBJECTIVE AND SCOPE
Article 1
The aim of this Directive is to protect the rights of members of supplementary pension schemes who move from one Member State to another, thereby contributing to the removal of obstacles to the free movement of employed and self-employed persons within the Community. Such protection refers to pension rights under both voluntary and compulsory supplementary pension schemes, with the exception of schemes covered by Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71.
Article 2
This Directive shall apply to members of supplementary pension schemes and others holding entitlement under such schemes who have acquired or are in the process of acquiring rights in one or more Member States.
CHAPTER II
DEFINITIONS
Article 3
For the purpose of this Directive:
(a) 'supplementary pension` means retirement pensions and, where provided for by the rules of a supplementary pension scheme established in conformity with national legislation and practice, invalidity and survivors' benefits, intended to supplement or replace those provided in respect of the same contingencies by statutory social security schemes;
(b) 'supplementary pension scheme` means any occupational pension scheme established in conformity with national legislation and practice such as a group insurance contract or pay-as-you-go scheme agreed by one or more branches or sectors, funded scheme or pension promise backed by book reserves, or any collective or other comparable arrangement intended to provide a supplementary pension for employed or self-employed persons;
(c) 'pension rights` means any benefits to which scheme members and others holding entitlement are entitled under the rules of a supplementary pension scheme and, where applicable, under national legislation;
(d) 'vested pension rights` means any entitlement to benefits obtained after fulfilment of the conditions required by the rules of a supplementary pension scheme and, where applicable, under national legislation;
(e) 'posted worker` means a person who is posted to work in another Member State and who under the terms of Title II of Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 continues to be subject to the legislation of the Member State of origin, and 'posting` shall be construed accordingly;
(f) 'contribution` means any payment made or deemed to have been made to a supplementary pension scheme.
CHAPTER III
MEASURES FOR SAFEGUARDING THE SUPPLEMENTARY PENSION RIGHTS OF WORKERS MOVING WITHIN THE COMMUNITY
Article 4
Equality of treatment as regards preservation of pension rights
Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure the preservation of vested pension rights for members of a supplementary pension scheme in respect of whom contributions are no longer being made to that scheme as a consequence of their moving from one Member State to another, to the same extent as for members in respect of whom contributions are no longer being made but who remain within the same Member State. This Article shall also apply to other persons holding entitlement under the rules of the supplementary pension scheme in question.
Article 5
Cross border payments
Member States shall ensure that, in respect of members of supplementary pension schemes, as well as others holding entitlement under such schemes, supplementary pension schemes make payment in other Member States, net of any taxes and transaction charges which may be applicable, of all benefits due under such schemes.
Article 6
Contributions to supplementary pension schemes by and on behalf of posted workers
1. Member States shall adopt such measures as are necessary to enable contributions to continue to be made to a supplementary pension scheme established in a Member State by or on behalf of a posted worker who is a member of such a scheme during the period of his or her posting in another Member State.
2. Where, pursuant to paragraph 1, contributions continue to be made to a supplementary pension scheme in one Member State, the posted worker and, where applicable, his employer shall be exempted from any obligation to make contributions to a supplementary pension scheme in another Member State.
Article 7
Information to scheme members
Member States shall take measures to ensure that employers, trustees or others responsible for the management of supplementary pension schemes provide adequate information to scheme members, when they move to another Member State, as to their pension rights and the choices which are available to them under the scheme.

Article 11
COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 98/57/EC of 20 July 1998 on the control of Ralstonia solanacearum (Smith) Yabuuchi et al.
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 43 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),
Having regard to the Opinion of the European Parliament (2),
Having regard to the Opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),
Whereas the harmful organism Ralstonia solanacearum (Smith) Yabuuchi et al. was previously known as Pseudomonas solanacearum (Smith) Smith; whereas Ralstonia solanacearum (Smith) Yabuuchi et al. is likely to become the generally accepted name for the organism; whereas the present Directive should take account of this scientific development;
Whereas potato and tomato production occupies an important place in Community agriculture; whereas the potato and tomato yield is constantly threatened by harmful organisms;
Whereas, through the protection of potato and tomato cultivation against such harmful organisms, not only should productive capacity be maintained but agricultural productivity should also be increased;
Whereas protective measures to prevent the introduction of harmful organisms into the territory of a Member State would have only a limited effect if such organisms were not controlled simultaneously and methodically throughout the Community and were not prevented from spreading;
Whereas one of the harmful organisms on potatoes and tomatoes is Ralstonia solanacearum (Smith) Yabuuchi et al., the pathogenic agent of the potato brown rot disease and of bacterial wilt in potatoes and tomatoes; whereas disease outbreaks caused by this pathogen have occurred in some parts of the Community and some limited sources of infection still exist;
Whereas there is a considerable risk to potato and tomato cultivation throughout the Community if effective measures are not taken, with respect to these crops, to locate this organism and determine its distribution, to prevent it from occurring and spreading, and, if found, to prevent its spread and to control it with the aim of eradication;
Whereas, in order to ensure this, certain measures must be taken within the Community; whereas Member States must, in addition, be able to take additional or stricter measures where necessary, provided that there is no hindrance to the movement of potatoes or tomatoes within the Community, except insofar as laid down in Council Directive 77/93/EEC of 21 December 1976 on protective measures against the introduction into the Community of organisms harmful to plants or plant products and against their spread within the Community (4); whereas such measures must be notified to the other Member States and to the Commission;
Whereas the measures have to take into account that systematic official surveys are necessary to locate the pathogen; whereas such surveys should include inspection procedures and, where appropriate, given that under certain environmental circumstances the disease can remain latent and unobserved both in the growing crop of potatoes and in stored potato tubers, should include sampling and testing procedures; whereas spread of the pathogen within the growing crop is not the most important factor, but whereas the pathogen can spread by surface water and certain associated wild solanaceous plants, and therefore the irrigation of potato and tomato crops using contaminated water appears to pose a risk for infection of such crops; whereas also the pathogen can exist through the winter in self-sown (volunteer) potato and tomato plants and these may be a source of infection being carried from one season to the next; whereas the pathogen is spread also by the contamination of potatoes through contact with infected potatoes and through contact with planting, harvesting and handling equipment or transport and storage containers which have become contaminated with the organism by previous contact with infected potatoes;
Whereas spread of the pathogen can be reduced or prevented by decontamination of such objects; whereas any such contamination of seed potatoes poses a major risk for the spread of the pathogen; similarly the latent infection of seed potatoes poses a major risk for the spread of the pathogen and this can be prevented by the use of seed potatoes produced in an officially approved programme whereby seed potatoes have been tested and found free from infection;
Whereas the current knowledge of the biology and epidemiology of Ralstonia solanacearum (Smith) Yabuuchi et al. under European conditions is incomplete and it is anticipated that a review of the measures proposed will be necessary within several seasons; similarly improvements to the test procedure are anticipated in the light of further research especially on the sensitivity and specificity of test methods in order to select and standardise the optimum test methods available;
Whereas, for the determination of the details of such general measures, as well as for those stricter or additional measures taken by Member States to prevent the introduction of the pathogen into their territory, it is desirable for Member States to cooperate closely with the Commission within the Standing Committee of Plant Health (hereinafter referred to as 'the Committee`),
HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:
Article 1
This Directive concerns the measures to be taken within the Member States against Ralstonia solanacearum (Smith) Yabuuchi et al., previously known as Pseudomonas solanacearum (Smith) Smith, (hereinafter referred to as 'the organism`), in order to, with respect to the host plants of the organism listed in Annex I Section 1, (hereinafter referred to as 'the listed plant material`):
(a) locate it and determine its distribution;
(b) prevent its occurrence and spread; and
(c) if found, to prevent its spread and to control it with the aim of eradication.
Article 2
1. Member States shall conduct annual systematic official surveys for the organism on the listed plant material originating in their territory. In order to identify other possible sources of contamination threatening the production of the listed plant material, Member States shall carry out a risk assessment and, unless no risk of spread of the organism has been identified during that assessment, they shall, in production areas of the listed plant material, conduct targeted official surveys for the organism on plants other than the listed plant material, including wild solanaceous host plants, as well as on surface water which is used for irrigation or spraying of listed plant material and on liquid waste discharged from industrial processing or packaging premises handling listed plant material and used for irrigation or spraying of listed plant material. The extent of these targeted surveys shall be determined according to the risk identified. Member States may also conduct official surveys for the organism on the material, such as growing medium, soil and solid waste from industrial processing or packaging premises.
2. The official surveys provided for in paragraph 1 shall be carried out:
(a) for the listed plant material, according to the details set down in point 1 of Section II, Annex I; and,
(b) for host plants other than the listed plant material, and for water including liquid waste, in accordance with appropriate methods and, where appropriate, samples shall be taken and subjected to official or officially supervised laboratory testing;
(c) where appropriate for other material, in accordance with appropriate methods.
For these surveys, further details of the inspection procedures and the number, origin, stratification and timing of collection of samples shall be decided by the responsible official bodies within the meaning of Directive 77/93/EEC based on sound scientific and statistical principles and the biology of the organism and taking into account in the Member State concerned, the particular production systems of the listed plant material and, as appropriate, of other host plants of the organism.
3. The details and results of the official surveys provided for in paragraph 1 shall be notified each year to the other Member States and to the Commission in accordance with the provisions of point 2 of Section II, Annex I. These notifications shall be submitted by 1 June except for potatoes use as farm-saved seed for which the notification shall be submitted by 1 September. The details and results for crops shall be related to the previous year's production. The details of these notifications may be submitted to the Committee.

- the appropriate methods for the surveys and the laboratory testing provided for in paragraph 2, first subparagraph, (b).
5. The following provisions may be adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 16a of Directive 77/93/EEC:
- the appropriate methods for the surveys provided for in paragraph 2, first subparagraph, (c),
- further details of the surveys provided for in paragraph 2, second subparagraph, with a view to ensuring comparable levels of assurance between Member States.
Article 3
Member States shall ensure that the suspected occurrence or confirmed presence of the organism in their territory shall be reported to their own responsible official bodies.
Article 4
1. In each case of suspected occurrence, the responsible official bodies of the Member State(s) concerned shall ensure completion of official or officially supervised laboratory testing using, for the listed plant material, the relevant method set out in Annex II and in accordance with the conditions specified in point 1 of Annex III, or, in all other cases, any other officially approved method, in order to confirm or refute the suspected occurrence. In the case of confirmation, the requirements laid down in point 2 of Annex III shall apply.
2. Pending the confirmation or refutation of a suspected occurrence under paragraph 1, in each case of suspected occurrence where, either:
(i) diagnostic symptoms of the disease caused by the organism have been seen and a positive result in the rapid screening test(s), as specified in Annex II section I, point 1 and section II has been obtained; or,
(a) prohibit the movement of plants and tubers from all crops, lots or consignments from which the samples have been taken, except under their control and provided that it has been established that there is no identifiable risk of the organism spreading;
(b) take steps to trace the origin of the suspected occurrence;
(c) introduce appropriate additional precautionary measures based on the level of estimated risk, particularly in relation to production of the listed plant material and the movement of seed potato lots other than those referred to in point (a), produced on the place of production from which the samples referred to in point (a) were taken, in order to prevent any spread of the organism.
3. In those cases of suspected occurrence where there is a risk of contamination of the listed plant material or surface water from or into another Member State(s), the Member State in which the suspected occurrence has been reported shall immediately notify, according to the risk identified, the details of the said suspected occurrence to the other Member State(s) concerned, and there whall be appropriate cooperation between the said Member States. The Member State(s) so notified shall introduce precautionary measures in accordance with paragraph 2(c) and take any further action, as appropriate, in accordance with paragraphs 1 and 2.
4. The following provision may be adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 16a of Directive 77/93/EEC:
- the measures referred to in paragraph 2(c).
Article 5
1. If official or officially supervised laboratory testing, using, for the listed plant material, the relevant method set out in Annex II or, in all other cases, any other officially approved method, confirms the presence of the organism in a sample taken pursuant to this Directive, the responsible official bodies of a Member State, having regard to sound scientific principles, the biology of the organism and the particular production, marketing and processing systems of the host plants of the organism in that Member State, shall:
(a) for the listed plant material;
(i) establish an investigation to determine the extent and primary source(s) of the contamination in accordance with the provisions of Annex IV, with further testing in accordance with Article 4(1), on, at least, all clonally related seed potato stocks, and,
(ii) designate as contaminated the listed plant material, consignment and/or lot from which the sample was taken, and the machinery, vehicle, vessel, store, or units thereof, and any other objects including packaging material which have been in contact with the listed plant material from which the sample was taken; also designate as contaminated, where appropriate, the field(s), unit(s) of protected crop production and place(s) of production from which the listed plant material was harvested and from which the sample was taken; and for those samples taken in the growing season, designate as contaminated the field(s), place(s) of production, and, where appropriate, unit(s) of protected crop production from which the sample was taken, and,
(iii) determine, in accordance with the provisions of point 1 of Annex V, the extent of probable contamination through pre- or post-harvest contact, through production, irrigation or spraying links or through clonal relationship with the designated contamination, and,

Article 13
COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 98/93/EC of 14 December 1998 amending Directive 68/414/EEC imposing an obligation on Member States of the EEC to maintain minimum stocks of crude oil and/or petroleum products
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 103a(1) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),
(1) Whereas the Council adopted Directive 68/414/EEC of 20 December 1968 imposing an obligation on Member States of the European Economic Community to maintain minimum stocks of crude oil and/or petroleum products (4);
(2) Whereas imported crude oil and petroleum products continue to play an important role in the Community's energy supplies; whereas any difficulty, even temporary, having the effect of reducing supplies of such products, or significantly increasing the price thereof on international markets, could cause serious disturbances in the economic activity of the Community; whereas the Community must be in a position to offset or at least to diminish any harmful effects in such a case; whereas it is necessary to update Directive 68/414/EEC adapting it to the reality of the internal market of the Community and the evolution of the oil markets;
(3) Whereas in Directive 73/238/EEC (5) the Council decided upon appropriate measures - including drawing on oil stocks - to be taken in the event of difficulties in the supply of crude oil and petroleum products to the Community; whereas Member States have undertaken similar obligations in the Agreement on an 'International Energy Programme`;
(4) Whereas it is important that the security of oil supply is enhanced;
(5) Whereas it is necessary that the organisational arrangements for oil stocks do not prejudice the smooth running of the internal market;
(6) Whereas the provisions of this Directive do not affect the full application of the Treaty, in particular the provisions concerning the internal market and competition;
(7) Whereas, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity and in accordance with the principle of proportionality as stipulated in Article 3b of the Treaty, the objective of maintaining a high level of security of oil supply in the Community through reliable and transparent mechanisms based on solidarity amongst Member States and, at the same time, complying with the rules of the internal market and competition, can be carried out more adequately at the level of the Community; whereas this Directive does not exceed what is necessary to achieve this objective;
(8) Whereas it is necessary that stocks are at the disposal of Member States should difficulties in oil supply arise; whereas Member States should possess the powers and the capacity to control the use of stocks so that they can be made available promptly for the benefit of the areas which most need oil supplies;
(9) Whereas organisational arrangements for the maintenance of stocks should ensure the stocks' availability and their accessibility to the consumer;
(10) Whereas it is appropriate that organisational arrangements for the maintenance of stocks are transparent, ensuring a fair and non-discriminatory sharing of the burden of the stock-holding obligation; whereas, therefore, information relating to the cost of holding oil stocks may be made available by Member States to interested parties;
(11) Whereas, in order to organise the maintenance of stocks, Member States may have recourse to a system based on a stockholding body or entity which will hold all, or part, of the stocks making up their stockholding obligation; whereas the balance, if any, should be maintained by refiners and other market operators; whereas partnership between the Government and the industry is essential to operate efficient and reliable stockholding mechanisms;
(12) Whereas indigenous production contributes in itself to security of supply; whereas the oil market evolution can justify an appropriate derogation from the obligation to maintain oil stocks for Member States with indigenous oil production; whereas, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, Member States may exempt undertakings from the obligation to maintain stocks in respect of an amount not exceeding the quantity of products which those undertakings manufacture from indigenously produced crude oil;
(13) Whereas it is appropriate to adopt approaches which are already followed by the Community and the Member States within their international obligations and agreements; whereas, owing to changes in the pattern of oil consumption, international aviation bunkers have become an important component of this consumption;
(14) Whereas there is a need to adapt and simplify the Community statistical reporting mechanism concerning oil stocks;
(15) Whereas oil stocks can, in principle, be held anywhere in the Community and, therefore, it is appropriate to facilitate the establishment of stocks outside national territory; whereas it is necessary that decisions for holding stocks outside national territory are taken by the Government of the Member State concerned according to its needs and supply security considerations; whereas in the case of stocks held at the disposal of another undertaking, or body/entity, more detailed rules are needed to guarantee their availability and accessibility in the event of oil supply difficulties;
(16) Whereas it is desirable, in order to ensure the smooth running of the internal market, to promote the use of agreements between Member States concerning minimum stockholding in order to further the use of storage facilities in other Member States; whereas it is for the Member States concerned to take the decision to conclude such agreements;
(17) Whereas it is appropriate to strengthen the administrative supervision of stocks and establish efficient mechanisms for the control and verification of stocks; whereas a regime of sanctions is necessary to impose such a control;
(18) Whereas Directive 72/425/EEC raised from 65 to 90 days the reference period appearing in the first paragraph of Article 1 of Directive 68/414/EEC and laid down the conditions to implement this increase; whereas that Directive has been rendered obsolete by this Directive; whereas Directive 72/425/EEC should therefore be repealed;
(19) Whereas it is appropriate to inform the Council on a regular basis on the situation concerning security stocks in the Community,
HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:
Article 1

Article 4
Owing to its specific characteristics, the Hellenic Republic shall be granted a non-renewable additional period of three years to apply the obligations of this Directive in relation to the inclusion of bunker supplies for international aviation in the calculation of internal consumption.
Article 5
The Commission shall submit regularly to the Council a report on the situation concerning stocks in the Community, including if appropriate on the need for harmonisation in order to ensure effective control and supervision of stocks.

Whereas, in accordance with Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90, maximum residue limits must be established progressively for all pharmacologically active substances which are used within the Community in veterinary medicinal products intended for administration to food-producing animals;
Whereas maximum residue limits should be established only after the examination, within the Committee for Veterinary Medicinal Products, of all the relevant information concerning the safety of residues of the substance concerned for the consumer of foodstuffs of animal origin and the impact of residues on the industrial processing of foodstuffs;
Whereas, in establishing maximum residue limits for residues of veterinary medicinal products in foodstuffs of animal origin, it is necessary to specify the animal species in which residues may be present, the levels which may be present in each of the relevant meat tissues obtained from the treated animal (target tissue) and the nature of the residue which is relevant for the monitoring of residues (marker residue);
Whereas, for the control of residues, as provided for in appropriate Community legislation, maximum residue limits should usually be established for the target tissues of liver or kidney; whereas, however, the liver and kidney are frequently removed from carcasses moving in international trade, and maximum residue limits should therefore also always be established for muscle or fat tissues;
Whereas, in the case of veterinary medicinal products intended for use in laying birds, lactating animals or honey bees, maximum residue limits must also be established for eggs, milk or honey;
Whereas danofloxacin, cefazolin and trimethoprim should be inserted into Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90;
Whereas lini oleum, folic acid, betain and cefazolin should be inserted into Annex II to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90;
Whereas, in order to allow for the completion of scientific studies, the duration of the validity of the provisional maximum residue limits previously defined in Annex III to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 should be extended for penethamate;
Whereas a period of 60 days should be allowed before the entry into force of this Regulation in order to allow Member States to make any adjustment which may be necessary to the authorisations to place the veterinary medicinal products concerned on the market which have been granted in accordance with Council Directive 81/851/EEC (3), as last amended by Directive 93/40/EEC (4), to take account of the provisions of this Regulation;

COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 539/98 of 9 March 1998 amending Regulation (EEC) No 3077/78 on the equivalence with Community certificates of attestations accompanying hops imported from non-member countries
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1696/71 of 26 July 1971 on the common organisation of the market in hops (1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1554/97 (2), and in particular Article 5(2) thereof,

COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 726/98 of 31 March 1998 amending Regulation (EC) No 2543/95 laying down special detailed rules for the application of the system of export licences for olive oil
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation No 136/66/EEC of 22 September 1966 on the establishment of a common organisation of the market in oils and fats (1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1581/96 (2), and in particular Articles 2 and 3 thereof,
Whereas Commission Regulation (EC) No 2543/95 (3), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 2126/96 (4), lays down special detailed rules for the application of the system of export licences for olive oil; whereas, with a view to improving the way the system works, specific detailed rules of application should be laid down for licences without advance fixing of the refund, in particular as regards the rate of the security and the timetable for the submission of application and the issuing of the licences; whereas experience has shown that the amount of the security and the periods for the submission of applications for licences and for their issue should be adjusted; whereas in order not to interfere with the normal pattern of exports without refunds the measures taken where there is a risk that the quantities for normal disposal will be exceeded should be restricted to exports licences giving entitlement to the payment of a refund; whereas, in order to monitor better the pattern of exports, the information to be supplied by the Member States should be specified;
Whereas the fourth indent of Article 5(1) of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3719/88 of 16 November 1988 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products (5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1404/97 (6), states that no licence shall be required for exports where the security would be ECU 5 or less; whereas the low level of that security for exports without refund means that a large number of exports could be made without a licence, which would weaken monitoring of the quantities concerned; whereas, to avoid that risk, special conditions should apply to such cases;
Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Oils and Fats,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
Regulation (EC) No 2543/95 is amended as follows:

Article 2
COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 1011/98 of 14 May 1998 amending Regulation (EEC) No 1722/93 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulations (EEC) No 1766/92 and (EEC) No 1418/76 concerning production refunds in the cereals and rice sectors respectively
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 of 30 June 1992 on the common organisation of the market in cereals (1), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 923/96 (2) and in particular Article 7(3) thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 of 22 December 1995 on the common organisation of the market in rice (3), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 192/98 (4), and in particular Article 7 thereof,
Whereas Regulation (EEC) No 1722/93 of the Commission of 30 June 1993 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulations (EEC) No 1766/92 and (EEC) No 1418/76 concerning production refunds in the cereals and rice sectors respectively (5), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1516/95 (6), envisages, for the calculating method of the production refund, a differentiation between starches containing maize, wheat, potatoes and rice on the one hand and starches containing barley and oats on the other; whereas experience has shown that the fixing of a specific amount for the product containing barley and oats is no longer necessary and that the single amount of the refund can hence apply to any starch without risk of inadequate compensation;
Whereas individual measures should be anticipated at the time of the change of the marketing year, concerning the term of validity of the refund certificates and the adjustment of the amount of the single refund;
Whereas, for the release of the individual guarantee in particular for esterified and etherified starches, it is advisable to specify the primary requirement to be fulfilled; whereas the special provisions applicable to these products still should be supplemented by certain measures aiming at the effectiveness of controls and the sanctions in the event of non-observance of the transformation or use of conditions;
Whereas the regulation stipulates currently that Member States notify each month to the Commission the statistical data covering at the same time the quantities of starch having benefited from the production refund and the products for which starch was used; whereas it appeared that this rhythm of information is too frequent and that it is advisable to replace it by a quarterly notification;
Whereas the Management Committee for Cereals has not delivered its opinion within the time limit fixed by its Chairman,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
'Article 3
1. In cases where a refund is granted, it shall be fixed once a month. However, if the prices of maize and/or wheat in the Community or on the world market change in a significant way, the refund calculated in accordance with paragraph 2 can be modified during this month to take account of these changes.
2. The refund per tonne of starch of maize, wheat, barley, oats, potatoes, rice or broken rice is calculated in particular on the basis of the difference between:
(i) the maize market price in the Community, valid during the five days preceding the day of fixing, taking into account the price levels noted for the wheat; and
(ii) the average of the representative cif import Rotterdam prices used for the determination of the import duties of the maize, noted during the five days preceding the day of the beginning of application,
multiplied by a coefficient of 1,60.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2081/92 of 14 July 1992 on the protection of geographical indications and designations of origin for agricultural products and foodstuffs (1), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1068/97 (2), and in particular Article 17(2) thereof,
Whereas, for certain names notified by the Member States under Article 17 of Regulation (EEC) No 2081/92, additional information was requested in order to ensure that they complied with Articles 2 and 4 of that Regulation; whereas that additional information shows that the names comply with the said Articles; whereas they should therefore be registered and added to the Annex to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1107/96 (3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 644/98 (4);
Whereas, following the accession of three new Member States, the six-month period provided for in Article 17 of Regulation (EEC) No 2081/92 is to begin on the date of their accession; whereas some of the names notified by those Member States comply with Articles 2 and 4 of that Regulation and should therefore be registered;

COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 1900/98 of 4 September 1998 amending Annex I to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 on organic production of agricultural products and indications referring thereto on agricultural products and foodstuffs
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 of 24 June 1991 on organic production of agricultural products and indications referring thereto on agricultural products and foodstuffs (1), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1488/97 (2), and in particular Article 13, first and second indent,
Whereas provisions regulating the characteristics of substrates for mushroom production should be included in Annex I, in order to permit organic production of mushrooms in the Member States under the same production conditions;
Whereas the agricultural components of these substrates should come, in principle, from holdings producing according to the organic production method;
Whereas however certain components, in particular straw and manure, can currently not be obtained in sufficient quantities from organic production; whereas therefore it is appropriate to foresee an appropriate transitional period to permit producers to adapt to the new requirements;
Whereas Article 7(2), third indent, establishes the possibility to define particular labelling requirements for products obtained with the aid of certain products referred to in Annex II to Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91; whereas in this particular production, it is appropriate to foresee an informative labelling with regard to the non-organic origin of the components of the substrate during the transitional period;
Whereas further refinement of the requirements as laid down in this Regulation should be considered, in particular with regard to the conditions of use including the maximum percentage of manure not from holdings producing according to the organic production method, the characteristics and the origin of the mycelium; whereas the preparatory works in this respect should be started in due time in order to be finalised before the end of the transitional period;
Whereas the length of the transitional period may be reviewed in view of any developments with regard to the availability of straw and manure from organic production;
Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee referred to in Article 14 of Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 is amended as shown in the Annex to the present Regulation.
Article 2
1. This Regulation shall enter into force on 1 December 1998.
2. By derogation to the provisions under points 5.1 and 5.2 of Annex I, may be used during a transitional period expiring on 1 December 2001:
- products referred to in point 5.1(a) of the Annex, not from holdings producing according to the organic production method but satisfying the requirements referred to in Annex II, Part A, indents 1 to 4 of Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91,
- and/or products referred to in point 5.2 of the Annex, not from holdings producing according to the organic production method, but satisfying, where relevant, the requirements referred to in Annex II, Part A of Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91,
if the products referred to in points 5.1(a) and 5.2 are not available from holdings producing according to the organic production method and the need is recognised by the inspection authority or body.
In such cases, the labelling and advertising shall contain a statement, with the wording 'Mushrooms cultivated on a substrate from extensive agriculture which is permitted in organic farming during a transitional period`. The word 'organic` in this statement, elsewhere on the label and/or on the advertising, shall not be more prominent than the other words of the statement.
This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.
COUNCIL REGULATION (EC, ECSC, EURATOM) No 2460/98 of 12 November 1998 amending Regulation No 7/66/Euratom, 122/66/EEC laying down the list of places for which a transport allowance may be granted, the maximum amount of that allowance and the rules for granting it
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing a single Council and a single Commission of the European Communities,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas, having regard to Council Regulation (EC, ECSC, EURATOM) No 2458/98 of 12 November 1998 amending Regulation (EEC, Euratom, ECSC) No 259/68 laying down the Staff Regulations of officials and the conditions of employment of other servants of the European Communities and the other Regulations applicable to them with regard to the establishment of remuneration, pensions and other financial entitlements in euros (1), Regulation No 7/66/Euratom, 122/66/EEC (2) should be amended,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
In Regulation No 7/66/Euratom, 122/66/EEC the term 'Belgian francs` is replaced by the term 'euros` and amounts expressed in Belgian francs are replaced by their equivalent in euro units at the conversion rate adopted by the Council.
The rules relating to the rounding of amounts laid down in Council Regulation (EC) No 1103/97 of 17 June 1997 on certain provisions relating to the introduction of the euro (3) shall apply.
Article 2
COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 2521/98 of 24 November 1998 amending Regulation (EC) No 577/97 laying down certain detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 2991/94 laying down standards for spreadable fats and of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1898/87 on the protection of designations used in the marketing of milk and milk products
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2991/94 of 5 December 1994 laying down standards for spreadable fats (1), and in particular Article 8 thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1898/87 of 2 July 1987 on the protection of designations used in the marketing of milk and milk products (2), as last amended by the Act of Accession of Austria, Finland and Sweden, and in particular Article 4(2) thereof,
Whereas Article 2(1) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 577/97 of 1 April 1997 laying down certain detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 2991/94 laying down standards for spreadable fats and of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1898/87 on the protection of designations used in the marketing of milk and milk products (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1298/98 (4), lays down the rules concerning indication of the fat content of spreadable fats with the exception of the products referred to in Regulation (EC) No 2991/94 having a minimum fat content of 80 %; whereas a method for verifying compliance with those rules is laid down in Article 2(3) of Regulation (EC) No 577/97 and in Annex II thereto; whereas the date of application of that method has been deferred to 1 January 1999 in order to allow users to gain experience with it and, on the basis of results forwarded to the Commission, to allow a thorough examination of its viability;
Whereas examination of the information forwarded has shown that the tolerances laid down for verification of the declared fat content are too narrow; whereas the tolerances for the averages of the results obtained from samples taken and for individual results should be doubled; whereas, under those circumstances, the requirement that each sample must comply with the limits laid down in the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 2991/94 can no longer be maintained; whereas the requirement that the average content established must comply with those limits must be stipulated;
Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinions of the relevant management committees,

(c) in all cases, the average fat content must comply with the limits laid down in the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 2991/94.`;
(b) paragraph 2 is replaced by the following:
Article 2
COUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 2531/98 of 23 November 1998 concerning the application of minimum reserves by the European Central Bank
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Protocol (No 3) on the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank (the 'Statute`) and in particular to Article 19.2 thereof,
Having regard to the recommendation of the European Central Bank (the 'ECB`) (1),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2),
Having regard to the opinion of the Commission (3),
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 106(6) of the Treaty establishing the European Community (hereinafter referred to as the 'Treaty`) and in Article 42 of the Statute and under the conditions set out in Article 43.1 of the Statute and paragraph 8 of the Protocol (No 11) on certain provisions relating to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,
(1) Whereas Article 19.2, in conjunction with Article 43.1 of the Statute, paragraph 8 of Protocol No 11 and paragraph 2 of the Protocol (No 12) on certain provisions relating to Denmark, are not to confer any rights or impose any obligations on a non-participating Member State;
(2) Whereas Article 19.2 of the Statute requires the Council to define, inter alia, the basis for minimum reserves and the maximum permissible ratios between those reserves and their basis;
(3) Whereas Article 19.2 of the Statute also requires the Council to define the appropriate sanctions in cases of non-compliance with those requirements; whereas specific sanctions are set out herein; whereas this Regulation refers to Council Regulation (EC) No 2532/98 of 23 November 1998, concerning the powers of the European Central Bank to impose sanctions (4) for the principles and procedures relating to the imposition of sanctions and provides for a simplified procedure for the imposition of sanctions in the event of certain kinds of infringements; whereas, in the event of a conflict between the provisions of the Regulation (EC) No 2532/98 and the provisions of this Regulation enabling the ECB to impose sanctions, the provisions of this Regulation should prevail;
(4) Whereas Article 19.1 of the Statute provides that the Governing Council of the ECB may establish regulations concerning the calculation and determination of the required minimum reserves;
(5) Whereas, in order to be effective as an instrument for the performance of money market management and monetary control functions, the system for the imposition of minimum reserves needs to be structured so that the ECB has the ability and flexibility to impose reserve requirements within the context of, and dependent upon, changing economic and financial conditions among participating Member States; whereas in this respect the ECB must have the flexibility to react to new payment technologies such as the development of electronic money; whereas the ECB may impose minimum reserves on liabilities resulting from off-balance-sheet items, in particular those that are either individually or in combination with other on-balance-sheet or off-balance-sheet items, comparable with liabilities recorded on the balance sheet, in order to limit the possibilities of circumvention;
(6) Whereas the ECB, in establishing detailed regulations for the imposition of minimum reserves, including determining the actual reserve ratios, any remuneration of reserves, any exemptions from minimum reserves or any modifications to such requirements applicable to any specific group or groups of institutions, is bound to act in pursuance of the objectives of the European System of Central Banks (the 'ESCB`) as set out in Article 105(1) of the Treaty and as reflected in Article 2 of the Statute; whereas this implies, inter alia, the principle of not inducing significant undesirable delocation or disintermediation; whereas the imposition of such minimum reserves may constitute an element of the definition and implementation of the monetary policy of the Community, being one of the basic tasks of the ESCB as specified in the first indent of Article 105(2) of the Treaty and as reflected in the first indent of Article 3.1 of the Statute;
(7) Whereas the sanctions provided in the event of non-compliance with the obligations set out in this Regulation are without prejudice to the possibility of the ESCB establishing appropriate enforcement provisions in its relations with counterparties, including the partial or total exclusion of an institution from monetary policy operations in the case of serious infringements of the minimum reserve requirements;
(8) Whereas the ESCB and the ECB have been entrusted with the task of preparing the monetary policy instruments to allow for their full operation in the third stage of Economic and Monetary Union (hereinafter referred to as 'Stage Three`); whereas an essential element of preparation is the adoption, ahead of Stage Three, of ECB regulations requiring institutions to hold minimum reserves as from 1 January 1999; whereas it is desirable to inform market participants during 1998 of the detailed provisions which the ECB may deem necessary to adopt for the implementation of the minimum reserves system; whereas it is therefore necessary to provide the ECB from the date of entry into force of this Regulation with a regulatory power;
(9) Whereas the provisions of this Regulation can only be effectively applied in their entirety if participating Member States adopt the necessary measures with a view to ensuring that their authorities have the powers to assist and collaborate fully with the ECB in carrying out the collection and verification of information as required by this Regulation, in accordance with Article 5 of the Treaty,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
2. 'national central bank` shall mean the central bank of a participating Member State;
3. 'institution` shall mean any entity in a participating Member State which, under the terms of Article 19.1 of the Statute, the ECB may require to hold minimum reserves;
4. 'reserve ratio` shall mean such percentage of the basis for minimum reserves as the ECB may specify in accordance with Article 19.1 of the Statute;
5. 'sanctions` shall mean fines, periodic penalty payments, penalty interest and non-interest-bearing deposits.
Article 2
Right to exempt institutions
The ECB may, on a non-discriminatory basis, exempt institutions from minimum reserves in accordance with criteria established by the ECB.
Article 3
Basis for minimum reserves
1. The basis for minimum reserves which the ECB may require institutions to hold according to Article 19.1 of the Statute shall include, subject to the provisions specified in paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Article:
(i) liabilities of the institution resulting from the acceptance of funds, together with
(ii) liabilities resulting from off-balance-sheet items, but excluding
(iii) fully or partly liabilities which are owed to any other institution according to modalities which shall be specified by the ECB, and
(iv) liabilities which are owed to the ECB or to a national central bank.
2. For liabilities in the form of negotiable debt instruments, the ECB may specify, as an alternative to the provision in paragraph 1 (iii), that liabilities which are owed by one institution to another shall be fully or partly deducted from the basis for minimum reserves of the institution to which they are owed.
3. The ECB may, on a non-discriminatory basis, allow the deduction of specific types of assets from categories of liabilities forming part of the basis for minimum reserves.
Article 4
Reserve ratios
1. Reserve ratios, which the ECB may specify according to Article 19.1 of the Statute, shall not exceed 10 % of any relevant liabilities forming part of the basis for minimum reserves but may be 0 %.
2. Subject to paragraph 1, the ECB may, on a non-discriminatory basis, specify differing reserve ratios for specific categories of liabilities forming part of the basis for minimum reserves.
Article 5
Regulatory power
For the purpose of Articles 2, 3 and 4, the ECB shall adopt, where appropriate, regulations or decisions.
Article 6
Right to collect and verify information
1. The ECB shall have the right to collect from institutions the information necessary for the application of minimum reserves. Such information shall be confidential.
2. The ECB shall have the right to verify the accuracy and quality of the information which institutions provide to demonstrate compliance with the minimum reserve requirements. The ECB shall notify the institution of its decision to verify data or to effect their compulsory collection.
3. The right to verify data shall include the right to:
(a) require the submission of documents;
(b) examine the books and records of the institutions;
(c) take copies or extracts from such books and records; and
(d) obtain written or oral explanations.
When an institution obstructs the collection and/or verification of information, the participating Member State in which the relevant premises are located shall afford the necessary assistance, including ensuring access to the premises of the institution, so that the abovementioned rights can be exercised.
4. The ECB may delegate to the national central banks the execution of the rights to which paragraphs 1 to 3 refer. In accordance with the first indent of Article 34.1 of the Statute, the ECB shall be empowered to specify further in a regulation the conditions under which the right to verify may be exercised.
Article 7
Sanctions in cases of non-compliance
1. Where an institution fails to hold all or part of the minimum reserves imposed in accordance with this Regulation and ECB regulations or decisions associated herewith, the ECB may impose either of the following sanctions:
(a) a payment of up to 5 percentage points above the ESCB's marginal lending rate or twice the ESCB's marginal lending rate, in both cases applied to the amount of the minimum reserves which the relevant institution fails to provide;
(b) the requirement for the relevant institution to establish a non-interest-bearing deposit with the ECB or the national central banks up to 3 times the amount of the minimum reserves which the relevant institution fails to provide. The maturity of the deposit shall not exceed the period during which the institution fails to hold the minimum reserves.
2. Whenever a sanction is imposed in accordance with paragraph 1, the principles and procedures set out in Regulation (EC) No 2532/98 shall apply. However, Article 2(1) and (3) and Article 3(1), (2), (3) and (4) of that Regulation shall not be applicable, and the periods referred to in Article 3(6), (7) and (8) thereof shall be reduced to fifteen days.
3. Where an institution fails to comply with the obligations deriving from this Regulation or ECB regulations or decisions associated therewith, other than those set out in paragraph 1, sanctions in cases of such failure and the limits and conditions relating to the imposition of such sanctions shall be those set out in Regulation (EC) No 2532/98.
Article 8
Final provisions
This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
DECISION OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE
of 16 December 1998
on the introduction of a harmonised form providing proof of invitation, sponsorship and accommodation
(SCH/Com-ex (98) 57)
THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE,
Having regard to Article 132 of the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement,
Having regard to Article 9 of the abovementioned Convention,
Whereas it is in the interest of all the Schengen States to apply uniform rules to the issue of visas in the context of their common policy on the movement of persons, with a view to preventing possible negative consequences as regards entry into Schengen territory and internal security,
HAS DECIDED AS FOLLOWS:
Point 1.4, Chapter V of the Common Consular Instructions on Visas (Verification of other documents depending on the application) lays down the use of a harmonised form providing proof of accommodation.
The form attached hereto allows for a high degree of flexibility and for use of the form adapted to the legal situation of each Contracting Party, since the Schengen States currently use very differing forms, for different types of obligation.
These differences have the effect in particular of increasing the risk of misuse and for that reason, the Schengen States are introducing a document incorporating features aimed at preventing counterfeiting and falsification.
Consequently, the standard document is uniform in terms of its:
- layout and structure and;
- security features.
The standard form shall be introduced in 1999 in the States implementing the Schengen Convention in which national law makes provision for this kind of proof.
1. The following sentence shall be added to point 1.4, Chapter V of the Common Consular Instructions: "Where the national laws of the Schengen States require proof of invitations from private individuals or for business trips, sponsorship declarations or proof of accommodation, a harmonised form shall be used(1)."
2. The Schengen Contracting Parties shall complete the harmonised form in accordance with their national laws.
3. The harmonised form to be used by the Schengen Contracting Parties for sponsorship declarations, invitations or proof of accommodation shall be drawn up at a central level, in accordance with the specifications laid down in Annex A (technical description of security features) and in Annexes A1 and A2 (specimen). The obligatory standard elements of the harmonised form are given in Annex B.
4. Specimens of the documents issued by the Contracting Parties shall be added to the Common Consular Instructions in the form of Annex 15.
5. France shall supply the films required for the production of the forms to the other Schengen States. The Contracting Parties shall bear the costs jointly.
6. The security features of the document shall be scrutinised at regular intervals (every two years, if possible) regardless of any general amendments which may prove necessary if the form is falsified by forgers or counterfeiters or if protective measures relating to security features have been revealed.
7. The document shall be produced in at least three languages.
8. This Decision shall enter into force when the Schengen States have sent notification that they have implemented the requisite measures.
COMMISSION DECISION of 25 January 1999 on the procedure for attesting the conformity of construction products pursuant to Article 20(2) of Council Directive 89/106/EEC as regards thermal insulating products (notified under document number C(1999) 115) (Text with EEA relevance) (1999/91/EC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 89/106/EEC of 21 December 1988 on the approximation of laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States relating to construction products (1), as amended by Directive 93/68/EEC (2), and in particular Article 13(4) thereof,
Whereas the Commission is required to select, as between the two procedures under Article 13(3) of Directive 89/106/EEC for attesting the conformity of a product, the 'least onerous possible procedure consistent with safety`; whereas this means that it is necessary to decide whether, for a given product or family of products, the existence of a factory-production control system under the responsibility of the manufacturer is a necessary and sufficient condition for an attestation of conformity, or whether, for reasons related to compliance with the criteria mentioned in Article 13(4), the intervention of an approved certification body is required;
Whereas Article 13(4) requires that the procedure thus determined must be indicated in the mandates and in the technical specifications; whereas, therefore, it is desirable to define the concept of products or family of products as used in the mandates and in the technical specifications;
Whereas the two procedures provided for in Article 13(3) are described in detail in Annex III to Directive 89/106/EEC; whereas it is necessary therefore to specify clearly the methods by which the two procedures must be implemented, by reference to Annex III, for each product or family of products, since Annex III gives preference to certain systems;
Whereas the procedure referred to in point (a) of Article 13(3) corresponds to the systems set out in the first possibility, without continuous surveillance, and the second and third possibilities of point (ii) of section 2 of Annex III, and the procedure referred to in point (b) of Article 13(3) corresponds to the systems set out in point (i) of section 2 of Annex III, and in the first possibility, with continuous surveillance, of point (ii) of section 2 of Annex III;
Whereas the measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Construction,
HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:
Article 1
The products and families of products set out in Annex I shall have their conformity attested by a procedure whereby the manufacturer has under its sole responsibility a factory-production control system ensuring that the product is in conformity with the relevant technical specifications.
Article 2
The products set out in Annex II shall have their conformity attested by a procedure whereby, in addition to a factory-production control system operated by the manufacturer, an approved certification body is involved in assessment and surveillance of the production control or of the product itself.
Article 3
The procedure for attesting conformity as set out in Annex III shall be indicated in mandates for guidelines for European technical approvals.
Article 4
This Decision is addressed to the Member States.

on minimum requirements for improving the safety and health protection of workers potentially at risk from explosive atmospheres (15th individual Directive within the meaning of Article 16(1) of Directive 89/391/EEC)
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 137 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1), submitted after consultation with the Advisory Committee on Safety, Hygiene and Health Protection at Work and the Safety and Health Commission for the Mining and Other Extractive Industries,
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee(2),
Acting in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 251 of the Treaty, in the light of the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee on 21 October 1999(3),
Whereas:
(1) Article 137 of the Treaty provides that the Council may adopt, by means of Directives, minimum requirements for encouraging improvements, especially in the working environment, to guarantee a better level of protection of the health and safety of workers;
(2) Under the terms of that Article, those Directives are to avoid imposing administrative, financial and legal constraints in a way which would hold back the creation and development of small and medium-sized undertakings;
(3) The improvement of occupational safety, hygiene and health is an objective which should not be subordinated to purely economic considerations;
(4) Compliance with the minimum requirements for improving the safety and health protection of workers potentially at risk from explosive atmospheres is essential if workers' safety and health protection is to be ensured;
(5) This Directive is an individual Directive within the meaning of Article 16(1) of Council Directive 89/391/EEC of 12 June 1989 on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health of workers at work(4); therefore, the provisions of the said Directive, in particular those relating to worker information, to the consultation and participation of workers and to the training of workers, are also fully applicable to cases in which workers are potentially at risk from explosive atmospheres, without prejudice to more restrictive or specific provisions contained in this Directive;
(6) This Directive constitutes a practical step towards the achievement of the social dimension of the internal market;
(7) Directive 94/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 March 1994 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States concerning equipment and protective systems intended for use in potentially explosive atmospheres(5) states that it is intended to prepare an additional Directive based on Article 137 of the Treaty covering, in particular, explosion hazards which derive from a given use and/or types and methods of installation of equipment;
(8) Explosion protection is of particular importance to safety; whereas explosions endanger the lives and health of workers as a result of the uncontrolled effects of flame and pressure, the presence of noxious reaction products and consumption of the oxygen in the ambient air which workers need to breathe;
(9) The establishment of a coherent strategy for the prevention of explosions requires that organisational measures complement the technical measures taken at the workplace; Directive 89/391/EEC requires the employer to be in possession of an assessment of the risks to workers' health and safety at work; this requirement is to be regarded as being specified by this Directive in that it provides that the employer is to draw up an explosion protection document, or set of documents, which satisfies the minimum requirements laid down in this Directive and is to keep it up to date; the explosion protection document includes the identification of the hazards, the evaluation of risks and the definition of the specific measures to be taken to safeguard the health and safety of workers at risk from explosive atmospheres, in accordance with Article 9 of Directive 89/391/EEC; the explosion protection document may be part of the assessment of the risks to health and safety at work required by Article 9 of Directive 89/391/EEC;
(10) An assessment of explosion risks may be required under other Community acts; whereas, in order to avoid unnecessary duplication of work, the employer should be allowed, in accordance with national practice, to combine documents, parts of documents or other equivalent reports produced under other Community acts to form a single "safety report";
(11) The prevention of the formation of explosive atmospheres also includes the application of the substitution principle;
(12) Coordination should take place when workers from several undertakings are present at the same workplace;
(13) Preventive measures must be supplemented if necessary by additional measures which become effective when ignition has taken place; maximum safety can be achieved by combining preventive measures with other additional measures limiting the detrimental effects of explosions on workers;
(14) Council Directive 92/58/EEC of 24 June 1992 on the minimum requirements for the provision of safety and/or health signs at work (ninth individual Directive within the meaning of Article 16(1) of Directive 89/391/EEC)(6) is fully applicable, in particular to places immediately contiguous to hazardous areas, where smoking, crosscutting, welding and other activities introducing flames or sparks may interact with the hazardous area;
(15) Directive 94/9/EC divides the equipment and protective systems which it covers into equipment groups and categories; this Directive provides for a classification by the employer of the places where explosive atmospheres may occur in terms of zones and determines which equipment and protective systems groups and categories should be used in each zone,
HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:

COUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 150/1999 of 19 January 1999 amending Regulation (EEC) No 2262/84 laying down special measures in respect of olive oil
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular, Article 43 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2),
Whereas, in accordance with Article 1(5) of Regulation (EEC) No 2262/84 (3), the Council, acting by a qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, is to adopt before 1 January 1999 the method for financing actual expenditure of agencies as from the 1999/2000 marketing year;
Whereas a three-year transitional period covering the reform of the market organisation of the olive-oil sector has been decided on as from the 1998/1999 marketing year; whereas work customarily entrusted to the agencies is to be carried out during the transitional period as well as during the first marketing year following that period; whereas, as a result, provision should be made for a Community contribution to the agencies' expenditure for the said period in order to ensure they can operate effectively and in accordance with the rules within the framework of the administrative autonomy provided for in Regulation (EEC) No 2262/84,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
The last two subparagraphs of Article 1(5) of Regulation (EEC) No 2262/84 are hereby replaced by the following:
'50 % of the agencies' actual expenditure over a period of three years starting from the 1999/2000 marketing year shall be covered by the general budget of the European Communities.
Before 1 October 2001, the Commission shall consider the need to maintain the Community contribution to the agencies' expenditure and, where appropriate, shall present a proposal to the Council. In accordance with the procedure provided for in Article 43(2) of the Treaty, the Council shall decide before 1 January 2002 on any financing of the expenditure in question`.

COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 568/1999 of 16 March 1999 amending Regulation (EC) No 577/97 laying down certain detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 2991/94 laying down standards for spreadable fats and of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1898/87 on the protection of designations used in the marketing of milk and milk products
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2991/94 of 5 December 1994 laying down standards for spreadable fats (1), and in particular Article 8 thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1898/87 of 2 July 1987 on the protection of designations used in the marketing of milk and milk products (2), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 222/98 (3), and in particular Article 4(2) thereof,

COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 676/1999 of 26 March 1999 amending for the fifth time Regulation (EC) No 785/95 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 603/95 on the common organisation of the market in dried fodder
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 603/95 of 21 February 1995 on the common organisation of the market in dried fodder (1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1347/95 (2), and in particular Article 18 thereof,
Whereas the first indent of Article 2(2)(a) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 785/95 of 6 April 1995 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 603/95 on the common organisation of the market in dried fodder (3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1794/97 (4), stipulates that the driers to be used for the dehydration of fodder must reach an air temperature at the entry point not less than 93 ¬∞C;
Whereas a large number of scientific studies show that high-temperature fodder drying safeguards the nutritional value of a high-quality product, in particular its beta-carotene content;
Whereas the situation on the market in dried fodder, characterised by price reductions and production increases, is such that it is necessary to guarantee supplies of a finished product of high nutritional quality obtained under comparable competitive conditions and to justify the amount of aid granted as a contribution to processing costs; whereas that objective can be achieved by extending the practice of high-temperature drying;
Whereas fodder processing is carried out at high temperature in most processing plants; whereas provision should therefore be made for those plants still operating at an air temperature at the entry point of 93 ¬∞C to be modified within a reasonable time limit so as to conform to that practice;
Whereas the technical modifications needed for that purpose make confirmation of approval of the plant by the competent authority indispensable;
Whereas a small number of horizontal belt driers producing an air temperature at the entry point of a least 110 ¬∞C are currently in use in some Member States; whereas these are small, low-capacity installations whose operating temperature cannot be increased without considerable technical modifications; whereas they may, therefore, be granted a derogation from the requirement for a minimum drying temperature of 350 ¬∞C, on the understanding that no new installations of this type will be approved after the beginning of the 1999/2000 marketing year;
Whereas Article 15(b) of Regulation (EC) No 785/95 provides that Member States must inform the Commission of the areas and quantities covered by delivery contracts and declarations; whereas experience has shown that that notification can be the source of contradictory and unsatisfactory information; whereas it should therefore be abolished;
Whereas the Management Committee for Dried Fodder has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its chairman,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
Regulation (EC) No 785/95 is hereby amended as follows:
1. in Article 2(2)(a), the first indent is replaced by the following:
Article 2
1. The technical modifications to driers made necessary by Article 1(1) shall be carried out without prejudice to the obligation to notify the competent authority within the time limit laid down in the last subparagraph of Article 4(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 785/95 in order to obtain confirmation of approval.
2. The Member States shall send the Commission, by 15 May 1999, a list of horizontal belt driers granted approval before the beginning of the 1999/2000 marketing year and consequently eligible for the derogation provided for in Article 1(1).
Article 3
This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 730/1999
of 7 April 1999
laying down the marketing standard for carrots
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 of 28 October 1996 on the common organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables(1), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2520/97(2), and in particular Article 2(2) thereof,
Where carrots are listed in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 as products for which standards are to be adopted; whereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 920/89 of 10 April 1989 laying down quality standards for carrots, citrus fruit and dessert apples and pears(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2536/98(4), has been the subject of multiple amendments and no longer ensures legal clarity;
Whereas the rules in question should therefore be recast and Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 920/89 repealed; whereas, to that end, for reasons of transparency on the world market, account should be taken of the standard recommended for carrots by the Working Party on Standardisation of Perishable Produce and Quality Development of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UN/ECE);
Whereas the effect of these standards must be to remove products of unsatisfactory quality from the market, gear production to satisfying consumer requirements and facilitate trade relations on the basis of fair competition, thereby helping to make production more profitable;
Whereas the standards are applicable at all stages of marketing; whereas transport over a great distance, storage for a certain lengh of time or the various handling operations to which the products are subjected may bring about deterioration due to the biological development of the products or their tendency to perish; whereas account should be taken of such deterioration when applying the standards at the marketing stages which follow dispatch; whereas, as products in the "Extra" class have to be particularly carefully sorted and packaged, only lack of freshness and turgidity is to be taken into account in their case;
Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Fresh Fruit and Vegetables,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
The marketing standard for carrots falling within CN code 0706 10 00 shall be as set out in the Annex.
The standard shall apply at all stages of marketing under the conditions laid down in Regulation (EC) No 2200/96.
However, at stages following dispatch, the products may show in relation to the provisions of the standards:
- a slight lack of freshness and turgidity,
- for products graded in classes other than the "Extra" class, slight deteriorations due to their development and their tendency to perish.
Article 2
Regulation (EEC) No 920/89 is hereby amended as follows:
1. in Article 1 the first indent is deleted;
2. Annex I is deleted.
Article 3
This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.

Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 805/68 of 27 June 1968 on the common organisation of the market in beef and veal(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1633/98(2), and in particular Article 12(1) thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 3066/95 of 22 December 1995 establishing certain concessions in the form of Community tariff quotas for certain agricultural products and providing for the adjustment, as an autonomous and transitional measure, of certain agricultural concessions provided for in the Europe Agreements to take account of the Agreement on Agriculture concluded during the Uruguay Round Multilateral Trade Negotiations(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2435/98(4), and in particular Article 8 thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1095/96 of 18 June 1996 on the implementation of the concessions set out in Schedule CXL drawn up in the wake of the conclusion of the GATT XXIV.6 negotiations(5), and in particular Article 1(1) thereof,
(1) Whereas, in the framework of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), the Community has undertaken to open two annual tariff quotas each for 5000 head for bulls, cows and heifers other than for slaughter of the mottled Simmental breed and of the Schwyz and Fribourg breeds and for cows and heifers other than for slaughter of the grey, brown, yellow and mottled Simental breeds and of the Pinzgau breed at rates of customs duty of 6 % and 4 % respectively; whereas those quotas should be opened on a multiannual basis for twelve-month periods commencing on 1 July, hereinafter referred to as "the year of import", and detailed rules should be laid down for their application;
(2) Whereas there should be a guarantee in particular of equal and continuing access to the said quotas for all interested operators within the Community and of uninterrupted application of the customs duties laid down for those quotas to all imports of the animals in question until the quotas are exhausted;
(3) Whereas experience has shown that limiting imports may lead to speculative import licence applications; whereas, in order to ensure that the planned measures function properly, the greater part of the quantities available should be allocated to "traditional" importers of bulls, cows and heifers of specified Alpine and mountain breeds; whereas in certain cases administrative errors by the competent national body are liable to restrict the access of importers to that part of the quota; whereas provision should be made to remedy any resulting prejudice;
(4) Whereas, in order to avoid forcing trade relations in this sector into an excessively rigid mould, a second tranche should be made available to importers who are able to show that they are engaged in genuine trade of some scale with third countries; whereas, in this connection and with a view to efficient management, the operators concerned must be required to have imported at least 15 head in the 12 months preceding the year of import in question; whereas a batch of 15 animals in principle constitutes a normal load and experience shows that the sale or purchase of a single batch is a minimum requirement for a transaction to be considered genuine and viable;
(5) Whereas, with a view to verifying compliance with these criteria, applications must be submitted in the Member State where the importer is registered for VAT purposes;
(6) Whereas, in order to prevent speculation, "traditional" operators no longer engaged in trade in beef and veal at 1 June prior to the year of import in question should be denied access to the quota;
(7) Whereas provision should be made for import rights to be allocated after a period of consideration and subject, where applicable, to the application of a uniform percentage reduction;
(8) Whereas provision should be made for the arrangements to be administered by means of import licences; whereas, to that end, provision should be made in particular for detailed rules on the way applications are to be submitted and on the particulars to be shown in applications and on licences, if necessary by way of derogation from, or by supplementing, certain provisions of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3719/88 of 16 November 1988 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance-fixing certificates for agricultural products(6), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1044/98(7), and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1445/95 of 26 June 1995 on rules of application for import and export licences in the beef and veal sector and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 2377/80(8), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2365/98(9);
(9) Whereas Article 82 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 of 12 October 1992 establishing the Community Customs Code(10), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 82/97(11), provides for customs supervision of goods released for free circulation at a reduced rate of duty on account of their end-use; whereas the animals imported should be monitored for a certain period to ensure they are not slaughtered during that time; whereas, in order to ensure that slaughter does not take place during that period, a security should be required to cover the difference between the common customs tariff (CCT) duty and the reduced duty applicable on the date of release for free circulation of the animals in question;
(10) Whereas Commission Regulation (EC) No 1012/98 of 14 May 1998 opening and providing for the administration of tariff quotas for the import of bulls, cows and heifers, other than those intended for slaughter, of certain Alpine and mountain breeds(12), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1143/98(13), must be repealed;
(11) Whereas, with a view to ensuring that the animals imported are not slaughtered for a certain period, Article 7(2) and (3) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1143/98 of 2 June 1998 laying down detailed rules for a tariff quota for cows and heifers of specified mountain breeds originating in various third countries, other than for slaughter, and amending Regulation (EC) No 1012/98 provides for the animals imported to be identified in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 820/97 of 21 April 1997 establishing a system for the identification and registration of bovine animals and regarding the labelling of beef and beef products(14) and for certain additional particulars; whereas, since those particulars are already compulsory, the two paragraphs in question should be deleted;
(12) Whereas, for the sake of clarity, Article 2(1)(a) and Article 8(c) of Regulation (EC) No 1143/98 should be corrected;
(13) Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Beef and Veal,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:

COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 1245/1999
of 16 June 1999
concerning the authorisation of new additives in feedingstuffs
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 70/524/EEC of 23 November 1970 concerning additives in feedingstuffs(1), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 866/1999(2) and in particular Article 9j and Article 3 thereof,
(1) Whereas Directive 70/524/EEC provides that new additives or uses of additives may be authorised, taking account of advances in scientific and technical knowledge;
(2) Whereas a new additive "Natrolite-phonolite" belonging to the group "Binders, anti-caking agents and coagulants" has been widely tested in some Member States; whereas, on the basis of the studies carried out, it appears that this new additive can be authorised;
(3) Whereas another new additive, "Clinoptilolite of volcanic origin", belonging to the group of "Binders, anti-caking agents and coagulants" has been successfully tested in certain Member States; whereas this new additive should be provisionally authorised;
(4) Whereas a provisional authorisation of new additives or uses of additives may be given if, at the level permitted in feedingstuffs, it does not adversely affect human or animal health or the environment, nor harm the consumer by altering the characteristics of livestock product, if its presence in feedingstuffs can be controlled, and it is reasonable to assume, in view of the available results, that it has a favourable effect on the characteristics of those feedingstuffs or on livestock production when incorporated in such feedingstuffs;
(5) Whereas the provisional authorisation of "Natrolite-phonolite" expired already on 21 April 1999; whereas therefore for the purpose of legal certainty it is necessary to provide for retroactivity of this Regulation;
(6) Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Feedingstuffs,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
"Natrolite-phonolite", belonging to the group "Binders, anti-caking agents and coagulants", shall be authorised in accordance with Directive 70/524/EEC as additive, E 566, in feedingstuffs under the conditions laid down in Annex I to this Regulation.
Article 2
"Clinoptilolite of volcanic origin", belonging to the group "Binders, anti-caking agents and coagulants", may be authorised in accordance with Directive 70/524/EEC as additive, No 3, in feedingstuffs under the conditions laid down in Annex II to this Regulation.
Article 3
This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
COUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 1258/1999
of 17 May 1999
on the financing of the common agricultural policy
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 37 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament(2),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee(3),
Having regard to the opinion of the Court of Auditors(4),
(1) Whereas by means of Regulation No 25 on the financing of the common agricultural policy(5), the Council established the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF), hereinafter referred to as "the Fund", which forms part of the general budget of the European Communities; whereas that Regulation laid down the principles which should apply for the financing of the common agricultural policy;
(2) Whereas at the single market stage, in view of the fact that price systems are standardised and the agricultural policy is a Community policy, the financial consequences devolve upon the Community; whereas, in accordance with that principle as laid down in Article 2(2) of Regulation No 25, refunds on exports to third countries, intervention aimed at stabilising agricultural markets, rural development measures, specific veterinary measures as laid down in Council Decision 90/424/EEC of 26 June 1990 on expenditure in the veterinary field(6), measures intended to provide information on the common agricultural policy and certain evaluation actions should be financed by the "Guarantee" section of the Fund in order to achieve the objectives set out in Article 33(1) of the Treaty;
(3) Whereas the "Guidance" section of the Fund should finance expenditure for certain rural development measures in regions whose development is lagging behind as well as for the rural development Community initiative;
(4) Whereas the Commission is responsible for the administration of the Fund and whereas close cooperation between Member States and the Commission is provided for within a committee for the Fund;
(5) Whereas the responsibility for checking the Fund's Guarantee Section expenditure lies, in the first place, with the Member States, which designate the authorities and bodies empowered to effect expenditure; whereas the Member States must carry out this task fully and effectively; whereas the Commission, being responsible for implementing the Community budget, must verify the conditions under which payments and checks have been made; whereas the Commission can only finance expenditure where those conditions offer all necessary guarantees regarding compliance with Community rules; whereas, in a decentralised system of management of Community expenditure, it is essential that the Commission, as the institution responsible for funding, its entitled and enabled to carry out all checks on the management of expenditure it considers necessary and that there should be full and effective transparency and mutual assistance between the Member States and the Commission;
(6) Whereas, during the clearance of accounts, the Commission is able to determine within a reasonable time the total expenditure to be entered against the Guarantee Section in the general account only if it has satisfactory assurance that the national controls are adequate and transparent and that the paying agencies verify the legality and regularity of the payment requests which they execute; whereas provision should therefore be made for the accreditation of paying agencies by Member States; whereas in order to ensure consistency in the standards required for accreditation in the Member States the Commission provides guidance on the criteria to be applied; whereas, for that purpose, it should be stipulated that only expenditure effected by paying agencies accredited by the Member States should be financed; whereas, moreover, in order to ensure the transparency of national controls, in particular as regards authorisation, validation and payment procedures, the number of authorities and bodies to which these responsibilities are delegated should, where appropriate, be restricted taking account of the constitutional arrangements of each Member State;
(7) Whereas decentralised management of Community funds, in particular following reform of the common agricultural policy, leads to the designation of several paying agencies; whereas, therefore, where a Member State accredits more than on paying agency, it must designate a single contact body to ensure consistency in the management of the funds, to provide liaison between the Commission and the various accredited paying agencies and to ensure that the information requested by the Commission concerning the operations of several paying agencies is made rapidly available;
(8) Whereas financial resources must be mobilised by the Member States in accordance with the needs of their disbursing agencies, while the Commission makes advance payments against the booking of the expenditure effected by the disbursing agencies; whereas in the framework of rural development measures, genuine advance payments for programme implementation should be provided for; whereas it is appropriate to treat these advance payments according to the financial mechanisms established for advances on the provision for expenditure effected in a reference period;
(9) Whereas two types of decisions should be established, one concerning the clearance of the Guarantee Section of the Fund, the other determining the consequences, including financial corrections, to be drawn from the results of the checks on conformity, with Community rules, of the expenditures;
(10) Whereas the checks on conformity and the ensuing clearance decisions will therefore no longer be linked to the implementation of the budget in a particular financial year; whereas the maximum period to which the consequences to be drawn from the checks on conformity may be applied must be determined; whereas, however, the pluriannual character of rural development measures does not allow the application of such a maximum period;
(11) Whereas measures must be taken to prevent and deal with any irregularities and to recover the amounts lost as a result of such irregularities or negligence; whereas the financial responsibility for such irregularities or negligence must be determined;
(12) Whereas Community expenditure must be made subject to close supervision; whereas, in addition to supervision carried out by Member States on their own initiative, which remains essential, provisions should be made for verification by officials of the Commission and for it to have the right to enlist the help of Member States;
(13) Whereas information technology needs to be used as fully as possible for producing the information to be sent to the Commission; whereas, when carrying out checks, the Commission just have full and immediate access to information on expenditure held in both documents and electronic files;
(14) Whereas the extent of Community financing makes it necessary for the European Parliament and the Council to be kept regularly informed by means of financial reports;
(15) Whereas, with a view to simplifying financial management, it is desirable to bring the financing period of the Fund closer to the financial year as set out in Article 272(1) of the Treaty; whereas carrying out such an operation requires having a clear picture of the funds currently available towards the end of the financial year concerned; whereas, therefore, provision should be made for the Commission to have the powers necessary to adapt the financing period of the Fund where there are enough remaining budgetary resources available;
(16) Whereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 729/70 of 21 April 1970 on the financing of the common agricultural policy(7) has been substantially amended on several occasions; whereas, now that new amendments are being made to the said Regulation, it is desirable, in order to clarify matters, that the provisions in question should be recast,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
It shall comprise two sections:
- the Guarantee Section,
- the Guidance Section.

(a) refunds on exports to third countries;
(b) intervention intended to stabilise the agricultural market;

DECISION OF THE CENTRAL GROUP
of 22 March 1999
on general principles governing the payment of informers
(SCH/C (99)25)
Informers play a valuable role in the fight against serious cross-border crime, and drug-related crime in particular, since they usually enjoy the trust of the offenders and thus use of such persons affords an opportunity to gain a general picture of the activities of clandestine criminal organisations and structures.
The Central Group acknowledges and endorses the - non-binding - "General principles governing the payment of informers" (Doc. SCH/Stup (98)72 Rev 2), subject to approval by the Executive Committee.

Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 933/94(5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2230/95(6) has laid down the active substances of plant protection products, designated by the rapporteur Member States for the implementation of Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92 and identified the notifiers for each active substance.
(2) Monolinuron is one of the 90 active substances covered by the first stage of the work programme provided for in Article 8(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC.
(3) In accordance with Article 7(1)(c) of Regulation (EC) No 3600/92, the United Kingdom, being the designated rapporteur Member State, submitted on 30 April 1996 to the Commission, the report of its assessment of the information submitted by the sole notifier in accordance with the provisions of Article 6(1) of this Regulation.
(4) The submitted report has been reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on Plant Health.

(7) Therefore, it is not possible to include this active substance in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC.
(8) A period of grace for disposal, storage, placing on the market and use of existing stocks in accordance with the provisions of Article 4(6) of Directive 91/414/EEC has to be provided.
(9) This Decision does not prejudice any action the Commission may undertake at a later stage for this active substance within the framework of Council Directive 79/117/EEC(7).
(10) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plant Health,
HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:
Article 1
Monolinuron is not included as active substance in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 90/539/EEC of 15 October 1990 on animal health conditions governing intra-Community trade in, and imports from third countries of, poultry and hatching eggs(1), as last amended by Directive 1999/90/EC(2), and in particular Article 23(1), 24, 26(2), 27a and 34 thereof,
Having regard to Council Directive 91/496/EEC of 15 July 1991 laying down the principles governing the organisation of veterinary checks on animals entering the Community and amending Directives 89/662/EEC, 90/425/EEC and 90/675/EEC(3), as last amended by Directive 96/43/EC(4), and in particular Article 10 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Decision 96/482/EC(5), as last amended by Decision 1999/549/EC(6), lays down the animal health conditions and veterinary certificates for the importation of poultry and hatching eggs other than ratites and eggs thereof from third countries including the animal health measures to be applied after such importation.
(2) Given the experience gained during the application of the measures provided for, the conditions under which day-old chicks originating from hatching eggs which have been imported from third countries are traded within the Community should be modified. The modification should enable Member States to dispatch day-old chicks to hodlings located in another Member State ensuring that the post importation isolation is carried out.
(3) It is necessary therefore to amend the model certificate as laid down in Annex IV to Directive 90/539/EEC and Decision 96/482/EC accordingly.
(4) It is necessary that the competent authority of the Member State of dispatch informs the competent authority of the final destination of the day-old chicks through the Animo system about the animal health requirements concerning the isolation period which have to be applied in these cases.
(5) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Veterinary Committee,
HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:
Article 1
Model 2 of Annex IV of Directive 90/539/EEC is hereby replaced by the Annex to this Decision.
Article 2
In Article 3 paragraph 1 of Decision 96/482/EC the following text is added:"If the day-old chicks are not reared in the same Member State which imported the hatching eggs, they shall be directly transported to and kept on the holding of destination referred to in point 9.2 in the animal health certificated Model 2 of Annex IV of Council Directive 90/539/EEC for a period of at least three weeks from the day of hatching."
Article 3
This Decision shall apply for consignments of day old chicks certified as from 1 October 2000.

Commission Decision
of 26 July 2000
pursuant to Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the adequacy of the protection provided by the safe harbour privacy principles and related frequently asked questions issued by the US Department of Commerce
(2000/520/EC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data(1), and in particular Article 25(6) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Pursuant to Directive 95/46/EC Member States are required to provide that the transfer of personal data to a third country may take place only if the third country in question ensures an adequate level of protection and the Member State laws implementing other provisions of the Directive are respected prior to the transfer.
(2) The Commission may find that a third country ensures an adequate level of protection. In that case personal data may be transferred from the Member States without additional guarantees being necessary.
(3) Pursuant to Directive 95/46/EC the level of data protection should be assessed in the light of all the circumstances surrounding a data transfer operation or a set of data transfer operations and in respect of given conditions. The Working Party on Protection of Individuals with regard to the Processing of Personal Data established under that Directive(2) has issued guidance on the making of such assessments(3).
(4) Given the different approaches to data protection in third countries, the adequacy assessment should be carried out and any decision based on Article 25(6) of Directive 95/46/EC should be enforced in a way that does not arbitrarily or unjustifiably discriminate against or between third countries where like conditions prevail nor constitute a disguised barrier to trade taking into account the Community's present international commitments.
(5) The adequate level of protection for the transfer of data from the Community to the United States recognised by this Decision, should be attained if organisations comply with the safe harbour privacy principles for the protection of personal data transferred from a Member State to the United States (hereinafter "the Principles") and the frequently asked questions (hereinafter "the FAQs") providing guidance for the implementation of the Principles issued by the Government of the United States on 21 July 2000. Furthermore the organisations should publicly disclose their privacy policies and be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) under Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act which prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce, or that of another statutory body that will effectively ensure compliance with the Principles implemented in accordance with the FAQs.
(6) Sectors and/or data processing not subject to the jurisdiction of any of the government bodies in the United States listed in Annex VII to this Decision should fall outside the scope of this Decision.
(7) To ensure the proper application of this Decision, it is necessary that organisations adhering to the Principles and the FAQs can be recognised by interested parties, such as data subjects, data exporters and data protection authorities. To this end the US Department of Commerce or its designee should undertake to maintain and make available to the public a list of organisations self-certifying their adherence to the Principles implemented in accordance with the FAQs and falling within the jurisdiction of at least one of the government bodies listed in Annex VII to this Decision.
(8) In the interests of transparency and in order to safeguard the ability of the competent authorities in the Member States to ensure the protection of individuals as regards the processing of their personal data, it is necessary to specify in this Decision the exceptional circumstances in which the suspension of specific data flows should be justified, notwithstanding the finding of adequate protection.
(9) The "safe harbor" created by the Principles and the FAQs, may need to be reviewed in the light of experience, of developments concerning the protection of privacy in circumstances in which technology is constantly making easier the transfer and processing of personal data and in the light of reports on implementation by enforcement authorities involved.
(10) The Working Party on Protection of Individuals with regard to the Processing of Personal Data established under Article 29 of Directive 95/46/EC has delivered opinions on the level of protection provided by the "safe harbor" Principles in the United States which have been taken into account in the preparation of the present Decision(4).
(11) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established under Article 31 of Directive 95/46/EC,
HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:
Article 1
1. For the purposes of Article 25(2) of Directive 95/46/EC, for all the activities falling within the scope of that Directive, the "Safe Harbor Privacy Principles" (hereinafter "the Principles"), as set out in Annex I to this Decision, implemented in accordance with the guidance provided by the frequently asked questions (hereinafter "the FAQs") issued by the US Department of Commerce on 21 July 2000 as set out in Annex II to this Decision are considered to ensure an adequate level of protection for personal data transferred from the Community to organisations established in the United States, having regard to the following documents issued by the US Department of Commerce:
(a) the safe harbour enforcement overview set out in Annex III;
(b) a memorandum on damages for breaches of privacy and explicit authorisations in US law set out in Annex IV;
(c) a letter from the Federal Trade Commission set out in Annex V;
(d) a letter from the US Department of Transportation set out in Annex VI.
2. In relation to each transfer of data the following conditions shall be met:
(a) the organisation receiving the data has unambiguously and publicly disclosed its commitment to comply with the Principles implemented in accordance with the FAQs; and
(b) the organisation is subject to the statutory powers of a government body in the United States listed in Annex VII to this Decision which is empowered to investigate complaints and to obtain relief against unfair or deceptive practices as well as redress for individuals, irrespective of their country of residence or nationality, in case of non-compliance with the Principles implemented in accordance with the FAQs.
3. The conditions set out in paragraph 2 are considered to be met for each organisation that self-certifies its adherence to the Principles implemented in accordance with the FAQs from the date on which the organisation notifies to the US Department of Commerce (or its designee) the public disclosure of the commitment referred to in paragraph 2(a) and the identity of the government body referred to in paragraph 2(b).
Article 2
This Decision concerns only the adequacy of protection provided in the United States under the Principles implemented in accordance with the FAQs with a view to meeting the requirements of Article 25(1) of Directive 95/46/EC and does not affect the application of other provisions of that Directive that pertain to the processing of personal data within the Member States, in particular Article 4 thereof.
Article 3
1. Without prejudice to their powers to take action to ensure compliance with national provisions adopted pursuant to provisions other than Article 25 of Directive 95/46/EC, the competent authorities in Member States may exercise their existing powers to suspend data flows to an organisation that has self-certified its adherence to the Principles implemented in accordance with the FAQs in order to protect individuals with regard to the processing of their personal data in cases where:
(a) the government body in the United States referred to in Annex VII to this Decision or an independent recourse mechanism within the meaning of letter (a) of the Enforcement Principle set out in Annex I to this Decision has determined that the organisation is violating the Principles implemented in accordance with the FAQs; or
(b) there is a substantial likelihood that the Principles are being violated; there is a reasonable basis for believing that the enforcement mechanism concerned is not taking or will not take adequate and timely steps to settle the case at issue; the continuing transfer would create an imminent risk of grave harm to data subjects; and the competent authorities in the Member State have made reasonable efforts under the circumstances to provide the organisation with notice and an opportunity to respond.
The suspension shall cease as soon as compliance with the Principles implemented in accordance with the FAQs is assured and the competent authorities concerned in the Community are notified thereof.
2. Member States shall inform the Commission without delay when measures are adopted on the basis of paragraph 1.
3. The Member States and the Commission shall also inform each other of cases where the action of bodies responsible for ensuring compliance with the Principles implemented in accordance with the FAQs in the United States fails to secure such compliance.
4. If the information collected under paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 provides evidence that any body responsible for ensuring compliance with the Principles implemented in accordance with the FAQs in the United States is not effectively fulfilling its role, the Commission shall inform the US Department of Commerce and, if necessary, present draft measures in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 31 of Directive 95/46/EC with a view to reversing or suspending the present Decision or limiting its scope.
Article 4
2. The Commission shall, if necessary, present draft measures in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 31 of Directive 95/46/EC.
Article 5
Member States shall take all the measures necessary to comply with this Decision at the latest at the end of a period of 90 days from the date of its notification to the Member States.
Article 6
This Decision is addressed to the Member States.

(2000/540/EC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 91/141/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant-protection products on the market(1) as last amended by Commission Directive 2000/10/EC(2) and in particular Article 6(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Directive 91/414/EEC (hereinafter "the Directive") has provided for the development of a Community list of active substances authorised for incorporation in plant-protection products.

Directive 2000/13/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council
of 20 March 2000
on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 95 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal of the Commission,
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee(1),
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty(2),
Whereas:
(1) Council Directive 79/112/EEC of 18 December 1978 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs(3) has been frequently and substantially amended(4). Therefore, for reasons of clarity and rationality, the said Directive should be consolidated in a single text.
(2) Differences between the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States on the labelling of foodstuffs may impede the free circulation of these products and can lead to unequal conditions of competition.
(3) Therefore, approximation of these laws would contribute to the smooth functioning of the internal market.
(4) The purpose of this Directive should be to enact Community rules of a general nature applicable horizontally to all foodstuffs put on the market.
(5) Rules of a specific nature which apply vertically only to particular foodstuffs should be laid down in provisions dealing with those products.
(6) The prime consideration for any rules on the labelling of foodstuffs should be the need to inform and protect the consumer.
(7) That need means that Member States may, in compliance with the rules of the Treaty, impose language requirements.
(8) Detailed labelling, in particular giving the exact nature and characteristics of the product which enables the consumer to make his choice in full knowledge of the facts, is the most appropriate since it creates fewest obstacles to free trade.
(9) Therefore, a list should be drawn up of all information which should in principle be included in the labelling of all foodstuffs.
(10) However, the horizontal nature of this Directive does not allow, at the initial stage, the inclusion in the compulsory indications of all the indications which must be added to the list applying in principle to the whole range of foodstuffs. During a later stage, Community provisions should be adopted, aimed at supplementing the existing rules.
(11) Furthermore, in the absence of Community rules of a specific nature Member States should retain the right to lay down certain national provisions which may be added to the general provisions of this Directive, nevertheless these provisions should be subject to a Community procedure.
(12) The said Community procedure must be that of a Community decision when a Member State wishes to enact new legislation.
(13) Provision should also be made for the Community legislator to derogate, in exceptional cases, from certain obligations that have been fixed generally.
(14) The rules on labelling should also prohibit the use of information that would mislead the purchaser or attribute medicinal properties to foodstuffs. To be effective, this prohibition should also apply to the presentation and advertising of foodstuffs.
(15) With a view to facilitating trade between Member States, it may be provided that, at stages prior to sale to the ultimate consumer, only information on the essential elements should appear on the outer packaging and certain mandatory particulars that must appear on a prepackaged foodstuff need appear only on commercial documents referring thereto.
(16) Member States should retain the right, depending on local practical conditions and circumstances, to lay down rules in respect of the labelling of foodstuffs sold in bulk; in such cases, information should nevertheless be provided for the consumer.
(17) With the aim of simplifying and accelerating the procedure, the Commission should be entrusted with the task of adopting implementing measures of a technical nature.
(18) The measures necessary for the implementing of this Directive should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(5).
(19) This Directive should be without prejudice to the obligations of the Member States concerning the time limits for transposition of the Directives set out in Annex IV, Part B,
HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:
2. This Directive shall apply also to foodstuffs intended for supply to restaurants, hospitals, canteens and other similar mass caterers (hereinafter referred to as "mass caterers").
3. For the purpose of this Directive,
(a) "labelling" shall mean any words, particulars, trade marks, brand name, pictorial matter or symbol relating to a foodstuff and placed on any packaging, document, notice, label, ring or collar accompanying or referring to such foodstuff;
(b) "pre-packaged foodstuff" shall mean any single item for presentation as such to the ultimate consumer and to mass caterers, consisting of a foodstuff and the packaging into which it was put before being offered for sale, whether such packaging encloses the foodstuff completely or only partially, but in any case in such a way that the contents cannot be altered without opening or changing the packaging.
Article 2
1. The labelling and methods used must not:
(a) be such as could mislead the purchaser to a material degree, particularly:
(i) as to the characteristics of the foodstuff and, in particular, as to its nature, identity, properties, composition, quantity, durability, origin or provenance, method of manufacture or production;
(ii) by attributing to the foodstuff effects or properties which it does not possess;
(iii) by suggesting that the foodstuff possesses special characteristics when in fact all similar foodstuffs possess such characteristics;
(b) subject to Community provisions applicable to natural mineral waters and foodstuffs for particular nutritional uses, attribute to any foodstuff the property of preventing, treating or curing a human disease, or refer to such properties.
2. The Council, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 95 of the Treaty, shall draw up a non-exhaustive list of the claims within the meaning of paragraph 1, the use of which must at all events be prohibited or restricted.
3. The prohibitions or restrictions referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall also apply to:
(a) the presentation of foodstuffs, in particular their shape, appearance or packaging, the packaging materials used, the way in which they are arranged and the setting in which they are displayed;
(b) advertising.
Article 3
1. In accordance with Articles 4 to 17 and subject to the exceptions contained therein, indication of the following particulars alone shall be compulsory on the labelling of foodstuffs:
(1) the name under which the product is sold;
(2) the list of ingredients;
(3) the quantity of certain ingredients or categories of ingredients as provided for in Article 7;
(4) in the case of prepackaged foodstuffs, the net quantity;
(5) the date of minimum durability or, in the case of foodstuffs which, from the microbiological point of view, are highly perishable, the "use by" date;
(6) any special storage conditions or conditions of use;
(7) the name or business name and address of the manufacturer or packager, or of a seller established within the Community.
However, the Member States shall be authorised, in respect of butter produced in their territory, to require only an indication of the manufacturer, packager or seller.
Without prejudice to the notification provided for in Article 24, Member States shall inform the Commission and the other Member States of any measure taken pursuant to the second paragraph;
(8) particulars of the place of origin or provenance where failure to give such particulars might mislead the consumer to a material degree as to the true origin or provenance of the foodstuff;
(9) instructions for use when it would be impossible to make appropriate use of the foodstuff in the absence of such instructions;
(10) with respect to beverages containing more than 1,2 % by volume of alcohol, the actual alcoholic strength by volume.
2. Notwithstanding the previous paragraph, Member States may retain national provisions which require indication of the factory or packaging centre, in respect of home production.
3. The provisions of this Article shall be without prejudice to more precise or more extensive provisions regarding weights and measures.
Article 4
1. Community provisions applicable to specified foodstuffs and not to foodstuffs in general may provide for derogations, in exceptional cases, from the requirements laid down in Article 3(1), points 2 and 5, provided that this does not result in the purchaser being inadequately informed.
3. The Community provisions referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 20(2).
Article 5
1. The name under which a foodstuff is sold shall be the name provided for in the Community provisions applicable to it.
(a) In the absence of Community provisions, the name under which a product is sold shall be the name provided for in the laws, regulations and administrative provisions applicable in the Member State in which the product is sold to the final consumer or to mass caterers.
Failing this, the name under which a product is sold shall be the name customary in the Member State in which it is sold to the final consumer or to mass caterers, or a description of the foodstuff, and if necessary of its use, which is clear enough to let the purchaser know its true nature and distinguish it from other products with which it might be confused.
(b) The use in the Member State of marketing of the sales name under which the product is legally manufactured and marketed in the Member State of production shall also be allowed.
However, where the application of the other provisions of this Directive, in particular those set out in Article 3, would not enable consumers in the Member State of marketing to know the true nature of the foodstuff and to distinguish it from foodstuffs with which they could confuse it, the sales name shall be accompanied by other descriptive information which shall appear in proximity to the sales name.
(c) In exceptional cases, the sales name of the Member State of production shall not be used in the Member State of marketing when the foodstuff which it designates is so different, as regards its composition or manufacture, from the foodstuff known under that name that the provisions of point (b) are not sufficient to ensure, in the Member State of marketing, correct information for consumers.
2. No trade mark, brand name or fancy name may be substituted for the name under which the product is sold.
3. The name under which the product is sold shall include or be accompanied by particulars as to the physical condition of the foodstuff or the specific treatment which it has undergone (e.g. powdered, freeze-dried, deep-frozen, concentrated, smoked) in all cases where omission of such information could create confusion in the mind of the purchaser.
Any foodstuff which has been treated with ionising radiation must bear one of the following indications:
- in Spanish:
"irradiado" or "tratado con radiaci√≥n ionizante",
- in Danish:
"bestr√•let/..." or "str√•lekonserveret" or "behandlet med ioniserende str√•ling" or "konserveret med ioniserende str√•ling",

- the trade name enables the nature of the ingredient to be clearly identified.
3. In the case of beverages containing more than 1,2 % by volume of alcohol, the Council, acting on a proposal from the Commission, shall, before 22 December 1982, determine the rules for labelling ingredients.
4. (a) "Ingredient" shall mean any substance, including additives, used in the manufacture or preparation of a foodstuff and still present in the finished product, even if in altered form.
(b) Where an ingredient of the foodstuff is itself the product of several ingredients, the latter shall be regarded as ingredients of the foodstuff in question.
(c) The following shall not be regarded as ingredients:
(i) the constituents of an ingredient which have been temporarily separated during the manufacturing process and later reintroduced but not in excess of their original proportions;
(ii) additives:
- whose presence in a given foodstuff is solely due to the fact that they were contained in one or more ingredients of that foodstuff, provided that they serve no technological function in the finished product,
- which are used as processing aids;
(iii) substances used in the quantities strictly necessary as solvents or media for additives or flavouring.
(d) In certain cases Decisions may be taken in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 20(2) as to whether the conditions described in point (c)(ii) and (iii) are satisfied.
5. The list of ingredients shall include all the ingredients of the foodstuff, in descending order of weight, as recorded at the time of their use in the manufacture of the foodstuff. It shall appear preceded by a suitable heading which includes the word "ingredients".
However:
- added water and volatile products shall be listed in order of their weight in the finished product; the amount of water added as an ingredient in a foodstuff shall be calculated by deducting from the total amount of the finished product the total amount of the other ingredients used. This amount need not be taken into consideration if it does not exceed 5 % by weight of the finished product,
- ingredients used in concentrated or dehydrated form and reconstituted at the time of manufacture may be listed in order of weight as recorded before their concentration or dehydration,
- in the case of concentrated or dehydrated foods which are intended to be reconstituted by the addition of water, the ingredients may be listed in order of proportion in the reconstituted product provided that the list of ingredients is accompanied by an expression such as "ingredients of the reconstituted product", or "ingredients of the ready-to-use product",
- in the case of mixtures of fruit or vegetables where no particular fruit or vegetable significantly predominates in proportion by weight, those ingredients may be listed in another order provided that that list of ingredients is accompanied by an expression such as "in variable proportion",
- in the case of mixtures of spices or herbs, where none significantly predominates in proportion by weight, those ingredients may be listed in another order provided that that list of ingredients is accompanied by an expression such as "in variable proportion".
6. Ingredients shall be designated by their specific name, where applicable, in accordance with the rules laid down in Article 5.
However:
- ingredients which belong to one of the categories listed in Annex I and are constituents of another foodstuff need only be designated by the name of that category.
Alterations to the list of categories in Annex I may be effected in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 20(2).
However, the designation "starch" listed in Annex I must always be complemented by the indication of its specific vegetable origin, when that ingredient may contain gluten,
- ingredients belonging to one of the categories listed in Annex II must be designated by the name of that category, followed by their specific name or EC number; if an ingredient belongs to more than one of the categories, the category appropriate to the principal function in the case of the foodstuff in question shall be indicated.
Amendments to this Annex based on advances in scientific and technical knowledge shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 20(2).
However, the designation "modified starch" listed in Annex II must always be complemented by the indication of its specific vegetable origin, when that ingredient may contain gluten,
- flavourings shall be designated in accordance with Annex III,
- the specific Community provisions governing the indication of treatment of an ingredient with ionising radiation shall be adopted subsequently in accordance with Article 95 of the Treaty.
7. Community provisions or, where there are none, national provisions may lay down that the name under which a specific foodstuff is sold is to be accompanied by mention of a particular ingredient or ingredients.
The procedure laid down in Article 19 shall apply to any such national provisions.
The Community provisions referred to in this paragraph shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 20(2).
8. In the case referred to in paragraph 4(b), a compound ingredient may be included in the list of ingredients, under its own designation in so far as this is laid down by law or established by custom, in terms of its overall weight, provided that it is immediately followed by a list of its ingredients.
Such a list, however, shall not be compulsory:
(a) where the compound ingredient constitutes less than 25 % of the finished product; however, this exemption shall not apply in the case of additives, subject to the provisions of paragraph 4(c);
(b) where the compound ingredient is a foodstuff for which a list of ingredients is not required under Community rules.

(c) where the ingredient or category of ingredients concerned is essential to characterise a foodstuff and to distinguish it from products with which it might be confused because of its name or appearance; or
(d) in the cases determined in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 20(2).
3. Paragraph 2 shall not apply:
(a) to an ingredient or category of ingredients:
- the drained net weight of which is indicated in accordance with Article 8(4), or
- the quantities of which are already required to be given on the labelling under Community provisions, or
- which is used in small quantities for the purposes of flavouring, or
- which, while appearing in the name under which the food is sold, is not such as to govern the choice of the consumer in the country of marketing because the variation in quantity is not essential to characterise the foodstuff or does not distinguish it from similar foods. In cases of doubt it shall be decided by the procedure laid down in Article 20(2) whether the conditions laid down in this indent are fulfilled;
(b) where specific Community provisions stipulate precisely the quantity of an ingredient or of a category of ingredients without providing for the indication thereof on the labelling;
(c) in the cases referred to in the fourth and fifth indents of Article 6(5);
(d) in the cases determined in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 20(2).

Article 27
Commission Directive 2000/63/EC
(Text with EEA relevance)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Whereas:
(1) It is necessary to establish purity criteria for all additives other than colours and sweeteners mentioned in Directive 95/2/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 February 1995 on food additives other than colours and sweeteners(3), as last amended by Directive 98/72/EC(4).
(2) Commission Directive 96/77/EC of 2 December 1996 laying down specific purity criteria on food additives other than colours and sweeteners(5), as amended by Directive 98/86/EC(6) set out purity criteria for a number of food additives. This Directive should now be completed with purity criteria for the remaining food additives mentioned in Directive 95/2/EC.
(3) It is necessary, in the light of technical development, to amend the purity criteria set out in Directive 96/77/EC for butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA). It is consequently necessary to adapt that Directive.
(4) It is necessary to take into account the specifications and analytical techniques for additives as set out in the Codex Alimentarius as drafted by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA).
(5) Food additives, if prepared by production methods or starting materials significantly different from those evaluated by the Scientific Committee for Food, or if different from those mentioned in this Directive, should be submitted for safety evaluation by the Scientific Committee for Food with emphasis on the purity criteria.
(6) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Foodstuffs,
HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:
Article 1
Directive 96/77/EC shall be amended as follows:
1. In the Annex, the text concerning E 320 - butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) shall be replaced by the text in Annex I to this Directive.
2. In the Annex, the text of Annex II to this Directive shall be added.
Article 2
1. Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive before 31 March 2001. They shall immediately inform the Commission thereof.
2. When Member States adopt these provisions, these shall contain a reference to this Directive or shall be accompanied by such reference at the time of their official publication. The procedure for such reference shall be adopted by Member States.
3. Products put on the market or labelled before 31 March 2001 which do not comply with this Directive may be marketed until stocks are exhausted.
Article 3
Directive 2000/69/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council
of 16 November 2000
relating to limit values for benzene and carbon monoxide in ambient air
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 175(1) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee(2),
After consultation of the Committee of the Regions,
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty(3),
Whereas:
(1) On the basis of principles enshrined in Article 174 of the Treaty, the European Community programme of policy and action in relation to the environment and sustainable development (the Fifth Environment Action Programme)(4), supplemented by Decision No 2179/98/EC of the European Parliament and the Council(5) on its review, envisages in particular amendments to legislation on air pollutants. That programme recommends the establishment of long-term objectives on air quality. Article 174 of the Treaty requires the precautionary principle to be applied in relation to the protection of human health and the environment.
(2) Article 152 of the Treaty provides that health-protection requirements are to form a constituent part of the Community's other policies. Article 3(1)(p) of the Treaty provides that the activities of the Community are to include a contribution to the attainment of a high level of health protection.
(3) Pursuant to Article 4(5) of Council Directive 96/62/EC of 27 September 1996 on ambient air quality assessment and management(6), the Council is to adopt the legislation provided for in paragraph 1 as well as the provisions laid down in paragraphs 3 and 4 of that Article.
(4) Directive 96/62/EC requires that action plans be developed for zones within which concentrations of pollutants in ambient air exceed limit values, plus any temporary margins of tolerance applicable in order to ensure compliance with limit values by the dates laid down.
(5) Directive 96/62/EC provides that the numerical values for limit values are to be based on the findings of work carried out by international scientific groups active in the field. The Commission is to take account of the most recent scientific research data in the epidemiological and environmental fields concerned and of the most recent advances in metrology for re-examining the elements on which limit values are based.
(6) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Directive should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(7).
(7) The amendments necessary for adaptation to scientific and technical progress may relate solely to criteria and techniques for the assessment of concentrations of benzene and carbon monoxide or detailed arrangements for forwarding information to the Commission, and may not have the effect of modifying limit values either directly or indirectly.
(8) The limit values laid down in this Directive are minimum requirements; in accordance with Article 176 of the Treaty, Member States may maintain or introduce more stringent protective measures; in particular, stricter limit values may be introduced to protect the health of particularly vulnerable categories of the population, such as children and hospital patients. A Member State may require that limit values be attained before the dates laid down in this Directive.
(9) Benzene is a human genotoxic carcinogen and there is no identifiable threshold below which there is no risk to human health.
(10) However, when limit values for benzene as set by this Directive are difficult to achieve because of site-specific dispersion characteristics or relevant climatic conditions and if the application of the measures would result in severe socio-economic problems, Member States may ask the Commission for one time-limited extension under specific conditions.
(11) In order to facilitate the review of this Directive in 2004, the Commission and the Member States should consider encouraging research into the effects of benzene and carbon monoxide, taking air pollution in enclosed spaces into account as well as that in outside air.
(12) Standardised accurate measurement techniques and common criteria for the location of measuring stations are an important element in the assessment of ambient air quality with a view to obtaining comparable information across the Community.
(13) Information on concentrations of benzene and carbon monoxide should be forwarded to the Commission as a basis for regular reports.
(14) Up-to-date information on concentrations of benzene and carbon monoxide in ambient air should be readily available to the public,
HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:
Article 1
Objectives
The objectives of this Directive shall be:
(a) to establish limit values for concentrations of benzene and carbon monoxide in ambient air intended to avoid, prevent or reduce harmful effects on human health and the environment as a whole;
(b) to assess concentrations of benzene and carbon monoxide in ambient air on the basis of common methods and criteria;
(c) to obtain adequate information on concentrations of benzene and carbon monoxide in ambient air and ensure that it is made available to the public;
(d) to maintain ambient air quality where it is good and improve it in other cases with respect to benzene and carbon monoxide.
Article 2
Definitions
The definitions in Article 2 of Directive 96/62/EC shall apply.
For the purposes of this Directive:
(a) "upper assessment threshold" shall mean a level specified in Annex III, below which a combination of measurements and modelling techniques may be used to assess ambient air quality, in accordance with Article 6(3) of Directive 96/62/EC;
(b) "lower assessment threshold" shall mean a level specified in Annex III, below which modelling or objective estimation techniques alone may be used to assess ambient air quality in accordance with Article 6(4) of Directive 96/62/EC;
(c) "fixed measurements" shall mean measurements taken in accordance with Article 6(5) of Directive 96/62/EC.
Article 3
Benzene
1. Member States shall take the measures necessary to ensure that concentrations of benzene in ambient air, as assessed in accordance with Article 5, do not exceed the limit value laid down in Annex I according to the dates mentioned therein.
The margin of tolerance laid down in Annex I shall apply in accordance with Article 8 of Directive 96/62/EC.
2. When the limit value laid down in Annex I is difficult to achieve because of site-specific dispersion characteristics or relevant climatic conditions, such as low windspeed and/or conditions conducive to evaporation, and if the application of the measures were to result in severe socio-economic problems, a Member State may ask the Commission for a time-limited extension. The Commission, acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 12(2) of Directive 96/62/EC, may, at the request of a Member State and without prejudice to Article 8(3) of this Directive, grant one extension for a period of up to five years if the Member State concerned:
- designates the zones and/or agglomerations concerned;
- provides the necessary justification for such an extension;
- demonstrates that all reasonable measures have been taken to lower the concentrations of the pollutants concerned and to minimise the area over which the limit value is exceeded, and
- outlines the future developments with regard to the measures which it will take according to Article 8(3) of Directive 96/62/EC.
The limit value for benzene to be granted during that time-limited extension shall, however, not exceed 10 Œºg/m3.
Article 4
Carbon monoxide
Member States shall take the measures necessary to ensure that concentrations of carbon monoxide in ambient air, as assessed in accordance with Article 5, do not exceed the limit value laid down in Annex II according to the dates mentioned therein.
The margin of tolerance laid down in Annex II shall apply in accordance with Article 8 of Directive 96/62/EC.
Article 5
Assessment of concentrations
1. The upper and lower assessment thresholds for benzene and carbon monoxide shall be those laid down in Section I of Annex III.
The classification of each zone or agglomeration for the purposes of Article 6 of Directive 96/62/EEC shall be reviewed at least every five years in accordance with the procedure laid down in Section II of Annex III to this Directive. Classification shall be reviewed earlier in the event of significant change in activities relevant to ambient concentrations of benzene or carbon monoxide.
2. The criteria for determining the location of sampling points for the measurement of benzene and carbon monoxide in ambient air shall be those listed in Annex IV. The minimum number of sampling points for fixed measurements of concentrations of each relevant pollutant shall be as laid down in Annex V, and they shall be installed in each zone or agglomeration within which measurement is required if fixed measurement is the sole source of data on concentrations within it.
3. For zones and agglomerations within which information from fixed measurement stations is supplemented by information from other sources, such as emission inventories, indicative measurement methods and air quality modelling, the number of fixed measuring stations to be installed and the spatial resolution of other techniques shall be sufficient for the concentrations of air pollutants to be established in accordance with Section I of Annex IV, and Section I of Annex VI.
4. For zones and agglomerations within which measurement is not required, modelling or objective-estimation techniques may be used.
5. The reference methods for the analysis and the sampling of benzene and carbon monoxide shall be as laid down in Sections I and II of Annex VII. Section III of Annex VII will set out reference techniques for air quality modelling when such techniques are available.
6. The date by which Member States shall inform the Commission of the methods used for the preliminary assessment of air quality under point (d) of Article 11(1) of Directive 96/62/EC shall be the date set out in Article 10 of this Directive.
7. Any amendments necessary to adapt the provisions of this Article and Annexes III to VII to scientific and technical progress shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 6(2) but may not result in any direct or indirect changes to limit values.

Article 11
Entry into force
Commission Regulation (EC) No 645/2000
of 28 March 2000
setting out detailed implementing rules necessary for the proper functioning of certain provisions of Article 7 of Council Directive 86/362/EEC and of Article 4 of Council Directive 90/642/EEC concerning the arrangements for monitoring the maximum levels of pesticide residues in and on cereals and products of plant origin, including fruit and vegetables, respectively
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 86/362/EEC of 24 July 1986 on the fixing of maximum levels for pesticide residues in and on cereals(1), as last amended by Commission Directive 1999/71/EC(2), and in particular Article 7 thereof,
Having regard to Council Directive 90/642/EEC of 27 November 1990 on the fixing of maximum levels for pesticide residues in and on products of plant origin, including fruit and vegetables(3), as last amended by Directive 1999/71/EC, and in particular Article 4 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 7 of Directive 86/362/EEC and Article 4 of Directive 90/642/EEC respectively set out basic provisions concerning the monitoring of pesticides in and on cereals and fruit and vegetables respectively.
(2) Experience in setting out and implementing Commission recommendations has shown that multiannual planning, with the possibility of annual adjustment, would be the most effective approach to establishing European Community coordinated monitoring programmes.
(3) Article 7 of Directive 86/362/EEC and Article 4 of Directive 90/642/EEC provide for review and adoption of any necessary measures, such as the publication by the Commission of European Community reports containing collated and compiled information of the Member States and the adoption of action to be taken at Community level in the case of reported infringements of the maximum levels. Experience has confirmed that in order that their reported results can be used with confidence, laboratories undertaking analyses of pesticide residues must operate with high levels of quality assurance. The participation of laboratories in regular proficiency tests and their implementation of common quality control procedures, may serve to fulfil the accreditation requirements of Article 3 of Council Directive 93/99/EEC of 29 October 1993 on the subject of additional measures concerning the official control of foodstuffs(4).
(4) Because the Commission, in collating and compiling the information submitted by the Member States for presentation as European Community reports, must have confidence in the quality, accuracy and comparability of that information it is appropriate, that the Commission should contribute financially to actions which support the undertaking at the highest standards achievable of the monitoring programmes. In particular the regular proficiency tests of laboratories and the review and development of quality control procedure guidelines at regular specialist meetings should be supported.
(5) It is appropriate that the Commission should contribute financially to actions which support other aspects of the coordination of pesticide residue monitoring at Community level. In particular work should be supported to allow the Commission to respond to the requirement that it should work progressively towards a system which would permit the estimation of actual dietary exposure from monitoring data.
(6) The communication from the Commission on consumer health and food safety (COM(97) 183) describes the operation of the food; veterinary and phytosanitary control and inspection services. The monitoring of pesticide residues in and on cereals and fruit and vegetables is an activity which should be covered by the inspection service.
(7) The monitoring exercises for 1996 and 1997 demonstrated infringements of the maximum levels as laid down in Directive 90/642/EEC as amended.
(8) Directive 90/642/EEC, as amended, as well as Directive 86/362/EEC, as amended provide for the adoption of actions to be taken at Community level in the case of reported infringements and for detailed implementing rules necessary for the proper functioning of the monitoring.
(9) A summary overview of the monitoring systems in all Member States is necessary to improve the monitoring of pesticide residues in the Community and to assist in its proper functioning.
(10) Detailed implementing rules necessary for the proper functioning of the monitoring provisions should be made. These rules should clearly set out the actions to, and procedures by, which the Commission may make financial contributions, within the available budgetary allocations.
(11) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plant Health,

Council Regulation (EC) No 657/2000
of 27 March 2000
on closer dialogue with the fishing sector and groups affected by the common fisheries policy
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 37 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament,
(2) In view of the tasks of the Advisory Committee on Fisheries and Aquaculture (ACFA) renewed under Commission Decision 1999/478/EC(1), these objectives of closer dialogue and transparency could be made easier by the introduction of new measures to improve the organisation of meetings of the ACFA, on the one hand, and the communication to the groups concerned of information concerning the issues at stake and the results achieved, on the other.
(3) To that end, the European trade organisations should be given help in preparing meetings of the ACFA with a view to stimulating comprehensive study of the issues involved in the CFP and the impact of its measures, fostering initiatives from the industry and seeking, if possible, common positions on Commission draft proposals.
(4) In order to improve the circumstances in which decisions are taken the industry should be informed at a very early stage of the initiatives planned and the aims and details of the different CFP measures should be explained to all the groups concerned,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
Within the conditions laid down in the Annex, the Commission shall bear the cost of:
- meetings arranged by the European trade organisations which are aimed at preparing meetings of the Advisory Committee on Fisheries and Aquaculture,
- explaining the objectives of, and measures relating to, the common fisheries policy, and in particular Commission proposals, and of disseminating relevant information in this field to the fishing industry and the groups concerned, maintaining regular contact with the organisations and groups concerned.

Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2081/92 of 14 July 1992 on the protection of geographical indications and designations of origin for agricultural products and foodstuffs(1), and in particular Article 17(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Additional information was requested on certain names notified by the Member States under Article 17 of Regulation (EEC) No 2081/92 in order to ensure that they comply with Articles 2 and 4 of that Regulation. That additional information shows that the names do comply with those Articles. They should therefore be registered and added to the Annex to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1107/96(2).

Commission Regulation (EC) No 1685/2000
of 28 July 2000
laying down detailed rules for the implementation of Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999 as regards eligibility of expenditure of operations co-financed by the Structural Funds
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999 of 21 June 1999 laying down general provisions on the Structural Funds(1), and in particular Articles 30(3) and 53(2) thereof,
After consulting the Committee pursuant to Article 147 of the Treaty, the Committee on Agricultural Structures and Rural Development and the Committee on Structures for Fisheries and Aquaculture,
Whereas:
(1) Article 1(3) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999 of 17 May 1999 on support for rural development from the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF) and amending and repealing certain Regulations(2) specifies that rural development measures which are integrated into the measures promoting the development and structural adjustment of regions whose development is lagging behind (Objective 1) or which accompany the measures supporting the economic and social conversion of areas facing structural difficulties (Objective 2) in the regions concerned, shall take into account the specific targets of Community support under the Structural Funds according to the conditions laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999. Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999 specifies the operations that may be concerned by support for rural development.
(2) Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 1783/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 July 1999 on the European Regional Development Fund(3) specifies the type of operations the ERDF may help finance.
(3) Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 1784/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 July 1999 on the European Social Fund(4), specifies the type of operations the ESF may help finance.
(4) Article 2 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1263/1999 of 21 June 1999 on the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance(5) specifies the type of measures the FIFG may help finance. Council Regulation (EC) No 2792/1999(6) lays down the detailed rules and arrangements regarding Community structural assistance in the fisheries sector.
(5) Article 30(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999 provides that rules on eligible expenditure should be the relevant national rules unless the Commission deems it necessary to adopt rules at Community level; for certain types of operation the Commission considers it necessary in order to guarantee the uniform and equitable implementation of the Structural Funds across the Community to adopt a common set of rules on eligible expenditure. The adoption of a rule relating to a particular type of operation does not prejudge under which of the abovementioned Funds such operation may be co-financed. The adoption of these rules should not prevent Member States, in certain cases which should be indicated, from applying stricter national provisions. The rules should apply to all expenditure incurred between the dates set out in Article 30(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999.
(6) Article 36(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999 provides that Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999 and the provisions adopted in implementation thereof apply, save as otherwise provided for under Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999, to rural development measures in areas covered by Objective 2 financed by the EAGGF (Guarantee section). Therefore, the rules set out in the present Regulation apply to such measures which form part of the programmes for Objective 2 regions except in so far as Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999 and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1750/1999(7) laying down detailed rules for the application of Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999 provide otherwise.
(7) Article 87 and 88 of the Treaty apply to operations co-financed by the Structural Funds. The decision of the Commission approving an assistance cannot prejudge any assessment in relation to State aid rules and does not relieve the Member State of its obligations under those Articles.
(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee on the Development and Conversion of Regions,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
The rules contained in the Annex to this Regulation shall apply in determining the eligibility of expenditure under forms of assistance as defined in Article 9(e) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999.
Article 2
This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.

Article 2
This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
Regulation (EC) No 2700/2000 of the European Parliament and of the Council
of 16 November 2000
amending Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Articles 26, 95 and 133 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee(2),
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty(3),
Whereas:
(1) Article 253(4) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 of 12 October 1992 establishing the Community Customs Code(4), provides that, before 1 January 1998, the Council is, on the basis of a Commission report, which may be accompanied by proposals, to review the Code with a view to making such adaptations as may appear necessary, taking into account in particular the achievement of the internal market.
(2) Every revision of the Code must, without instituting any barriers to international trade, be regarded as an opportunity to introduce instruments and procedures to prevent fraud, the prevention of fraud being one of the best ways of saving taxpayers' money as underlined in the Council's conclusions of 19 May 1998.
(3) Account should be taken of the Council resolution of 25 October 1996 on the simplification and rationalisation of the Community's customs regulations and procedures(5).
(4) The powers of the different authorities to establish exchange rates following the introduction of the euro have not yet been decided.
(5) Provision should be made for the possibility of customs declarations lodged by means of a data-processing technique not being accompanied by certain documents.
(6) In order to make it easier to take advantage of the arrangements for inward processing, processing under customs control and temporary importation, the rules should be made more flexible.
(7) It is appropriate to make provision, in accordance with the committee procedure, for additional cases in which charges due under outward processing arrangements are calculated taking the cost of processing operations as a basis.
(8) In some free zones it may be appropriate to permit completion of the formalities attaching to the customs warehousing procedure and the carrying out of customs checks by the customs authorities according to that procedure.
(9) In certain circumstances, the benefit of favourable tariff treatment granted by reason of the nature or end-use of goods and of differential charges under the outward processing procedure should also be available where a customs debt is incurred for reasons other than the release of goods into free circulation.
(10) The provisions relating to the place where a customs debt is incurred should include special rules for particular cases where the sum involved is below a given threshold.
(11) It is necessary, for the particular case of preferential arrangements, to define the concepts of error by the customs authorities and of the good faith of the person liable for payment. The person liable for payment should not be held responsible for a malfunction of the system due to an error made by the authorities of a third country. The issue of an incorrect certificate by such authorities should not, however, be considered an error if the certificate is based on an application which contains incorrect information. The incorrect nature of the information provided by the exporter in his application must be assessed on the basis of all the factual elements which are contained in that application. The person liable for payment can plead his good faith where he can demonstrate that he has taken due care, except when a notice stating that there are grounds for doubt has been published in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
(12) The Community's financial interests and the rights of the person liable for payment should be protected against unduly lengthy legal proceedings.
(13) Provision should be made for suspending the obligation to pay a customs debt incurred where goods have been removed from customs supervision and there is more than one debtor, so as to allow customs authorities to initiate recovery proceedings against one particular debtor, taking priority over other debtors.
(14) The measures necessary for the implementation of Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(6).
(15) Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 should therefore be amended accordingly,

Where the preferential status of the goods is established on the basis of a system of administrative cooperation involving the authorities of a third country, the issue of a certificate by those authorities, should it prove to be incorrect, shall constitute an error which could not reasonably have been detected within the meaning of the first subparagraph.

Whereas:
(1) The sampling plans and diagnostic methods for the detection and confirmation of certain fish diseases have been laid down in Commision Decision 92/532/EEC(3), as amended by Commission Decision 96/240/EC(4).
(2) Since the time of adoption of Decision 92/532/EEC, new practical and scientific developments have taken place and Directive 91/67/EEC has been amended. This requires the sampling plans and diagnostic methods to be updated.
(3) Such updating relates to the examination and identification of viruses causing viral haemorrhagic septicaemia (VHS) and infectious haematopoietic necrosis (IHN) and to changes in accordance with the last amendments of Directive 91/67/EEC.
(4) The Community reference laboratory for fish diseases, established by Council Directive 93/53/EEC(5), has been consulted.

Council Decision
of 23 July 2001
amending Decision 90/424/EEC on expenditure in the veterinary field
(2001/572/EC)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Decision 90/424/EEC of 26 June 1990 on expenditure in the veterinary field(1), and in particular Article 24(1) and (2) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal of the Commission,
Whereas:
(1) Decision 90/424/EEC provides for the possibility of a financial contribution from the Community for the eradication and monitoring of the diseases contained in the list annexed to that Decision.
(2) The list may be supplemented or amended to take account of developments in the health situation in the Community.
(3) Infectious salmon anaemia (ISA) is a new disease that appeared for the first time in the Community in 1998 which has the potential of causing important losses for the salmon farming industry.
(4) It is important that ISA is controlled so as to prevent its further spread to other areas.
(5) Bluetongue is an arthropod-borne viral disease of sheep, goats, cattle and other ruminants.
(6) Bluetongue has an impact at international level on movements of live animals of sensitive species in that it is included on List A of the World Organisation for Animal Health.
(7) In 1998 Bluetongue entered from abroad the territory of the Community and spread via infected vectors.
(8) Certain areas of the European Union must, due to climatic conditions, be considered as Bluetongue high risk areas.
(9) Decision 90/424/EEC provides for emergency measures caused by Bluetongue outbreaks. A Community financial contribution is also required for monitoring and certain control measures including vaccination against Bluetongue in high risk areas or in areas where the disease is endemic.
(10) In the light of these developments, ISA and Bluetongue should be added to the list in question so that a Community financial contribution can be obtained for the implementation of programmes for the eradication and monitoring of these diseases. In the case of Bluetongue, specific criteria should be adopted to enable the financial measure provided for in Article 24(1) of Decision 90/424/EEC to be implemented.
(11) In order to be eligible for a Community financial contribution, the relevant requirements of Decision 90/424/EEC and, with regard to ISA, Council Directive 93/53/EEC of 24 June 1993 introducing minimum Community measures for the control of certain fish diseases(2) must be respected.
(12) Council Regulation (EC) No 2792/1999 of 17 December 1999 laying down the detailed rules and arrangements regarding Community structural assistance in the fisheries sector(3) and in particular Article 15(3)(g) thereof, is the appropriate legal basis for ensuring a financial assistance with regard to ISA; therefore the provisions of Title III of Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999 of 21 June 1999 laying down general provisions on the Structural Funds(4) are applicable by derogation to those provided for under Article 24, paragraphs 5, 6, second sentence, 8 and 9 of Decision 90/424/EEC.
(13) Decision 90/424/EEC should accordingly be amended,
HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:
Article 1
In the Annex to Decision 90/424/EEC the following indents shall be added to group 1: "- Infectious salmon anaemia (ISA)(5)
- Bluetongue in endemic or high risk areas(6).".
Article 2
This Decision is addressed to the Member States.

(2) Article 1(4) of Directive 91/689/EEC requires Member States to notify the Commission of waste not included on the list of hazardous waste which they consider to display one or more of the properties listed in Annex III to that Directive. Several Member States have notified waste containing chlorosilanes, waste containing silicones and construction materials containing asbestos and requested that the list of hazardous waste be adapted accordingly.
(3) For the sake of clarity, it should be expressly provided that exclusively grease and oil mixture from oil/water separation containing only edible oil and fats can be considered non-hazardous.
(4) Decision 2000/532/EC should be amended accordingly.
(5) The measures provided for in this Decision are not in accordance with the opinion delivered by the Committee established by Article 18 of Directive 75/442/EEC of 15 July 1975 on waste(3). They must therefore, by virtue of the fourth paragraph of Article 18 of Directive 75/442/EEC, be adopted by the Council,

Council Framework Decision
of 28 May 2001
combating fraud and counterfeiting of non-cash means of payment
(2001/413/JHA)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty on European Union, and in particular Article 34(2)(b) thereof,
Having regard to the initiative of the Commission(1),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament(2),
Whereas:
(1) Fraud and counterfeiting of non-cash means of payment often operate on an international scale.
(2) The work developed by various international organisations (i.e. the Council of Europe, the Group of Eight, the OECD, Interpol and the UN) is important but needs to be complemented by action of the European Union.
(3) The Council considers that the seriousness and development of certain forms of fraud regarding non-cash means of payment require comprehensive solutions. Recommendation No 18 of the Action Plan to combat organised crime(3), approved by the Amsterdam European Council on 16 and 17 June 1997, as well as point 46 of the Action Plan of the Council and the Commission on how to implement the provisions of the Treaty of Amsterdam on an area of freedom, security and justice(4), approved by the Vienna European Council on 11 and 12 December 1998, call for an action on this subject.
(4) Since the objectives of this Framework Decision, namely to ensure that fraud and counterfeiting involving all forms of non-cash means of payment are recognised as criminal offences and are subject to effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions in all Member States cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States in view of the international dimension of those offences and can therefore be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty establishing the European Community. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Framework Decision does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.
(5) This Framework Decision should assist in the fight against fraud and counterfeiting involving non-cash means of payment together with other instruments already agreed by the Council such as Joint Action 98/428/JHA on the creation of a European Judicial Network(5), Joint Action 98/733/JHA on making it a criminal offence to participate in a criminal organisation in the Member States of the European Union(6), Joint Action 98/699/JHA on money laundering, the identification, tracing, freezing, seizing and confiscation of instrumentalities and the proceeds from crime(7), as well as the Decision of 29 April 1999 extending Europol's mandate to deal with forgery of money and means of payment(8).
(6) The Commission submitted to the Council, on 1 July 1998, the Communication entitled "A framework for action combating fraud and counterfeit of non-cash means of payment" which advocates a Union Policy covering both preventive and repressive aspects of the problem.
(7) The Communication contains a Draft Joint Action which is one element of that comprehensive approach, and constitutes the starting point for this Framework Decision.
(8) It is necessary that a description of the different forms of behaviour requiring criminalisation in relation to fraud and counterfeiting of non-cash means of payment cover the whole range of activities that together constitute the menace of organised crime in this regard.
(9) It is necessary that these forms of behaviour be classified as criminal offences in all Member States, and that effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions be provided for natural and legal persons having committed, or being liable for, such offences.
(10) By giving protection by penal law primarily to payment instruments that are provided with a special form of protection against imitation or abuse, the intention is to encourage operators to provide that protection to payment instruments issued by them, and thereby to add an element of prevention to the instrument.
(11) It is necessary that Member States afford each other the widest measure of mutual assistance, and that they consult each other when two or more Member States have jurisdiction over the same offence,

Directive 2001/108/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council
of 21 January 2002
amending Council Directive 85/611/EEC on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS), with regard to investments of UCITS
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 47(2) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee(2),
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty(3),
Whereas:
(1) The scope of Council Directive 85/611/EEC(4) was confined initially to collective investment undertakings of the open-ended type which promote the sale of their units to the public in the Community and the sole object of which is investment in transferable securities (UCITS). It was envisaged in the preamble to Directive 85/611/EEC that collective investment undertakings falling outside its scope would be the subject of coordination at a later stage.
(2) Taking into account market developments, it is desirable that the investment objective of UCITS be widened in order to permit them to invest in financial instruments, other than transferable securities, which are sufficiently liquid. The financial instruments which are eligible to be investment assets of the portfolio of the UCITS are listed in this Directive. The selection of investments for a portfolio by means of an index is a management technique.
(3) The definition of transferable securities included in this Directive is valid only for this Directive and in no way affects the various definitions used in national legislation for other purposes such as taxation. Consequently, shares and other securities equivalent to shares issued by bodies such as building societies and industrial and provident societies, the ownership of which cannot in practice be transferred except by the issuing body buying them back, are not covered by this definition.
(4) Money market instruments cover those transferable instruments which are normally not traded on regulated markets but dealt in on the money market, for example treasury and local authority bills, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, medium-term notes and bankers' acceptances.
(5) It is useful to ensure that the concept of regulated market in this Directive corresponds to that in Council Directive 93/22/EEC of 10 May 1993 on investment services in the securities field(5).
(6) It is desirable to permit a UCITS to invest its assets in units of UCITS and/or other collective investment undertakings of the open-ended type which also invest in liquid financial assets mentioned in this Directive and which operate on the principle of risk spreading. It is necessary that UCITS or other collective investment undertakings in which a UCITS invests be subject to effective supervision.
(7) The development of opportunities for a UCITS to invest in UCITS and in other collective investment undertakings should be facilitated. It is therefore essential to ensure that such investment activity does not diminish investor protection. Owing to the enhanced possibilities for UCITS to invest in the units of other UCITS and/or collective investment undertakings, it is necessary to lay down certain rules on quantitative limits, the disclosure of information and prevention of the cascade phenomenon.
(8) To take market developments into account and in consideration of the completion of economic and monetary union it is desirable to permit UCITS to invest in bank deposits. To ensure adequate liquidity of investments in deposits, these deposits are to be repayable on demand or have the right to be withdrawn. If the deposits are made with a credit institution the registered office of which is located in a non-Member State, the credit institution should be subject to prudential rules equivalent to those laid down in Community legislation.
(9) In addition to the case in which a UCITS invests in bank deposits according to its fund rules or instruments of incorporation, it may be necessary to allow all UCITS to hold ancillary liquid assets, such as bank deposits at sight. The holding of such ancillary liquid assets may be justified, for example, in the following cases: in order to cover current or exceptional payments; in the case of sales, for the time necessary to reinvest in transferable securities, money market instruments and/or in other financial assets provided for in this Directive; for a period of time strictly necessary when, because of unfavourable market conditions, the investment in transferable securities, money market instruments and in other financial assets must be suspended.
(10) For prudential reasons it is necessary to avoid excessive concentration by a UCITS in investments which expose them to counterparty risk to the same entity or to entities belonging to the same group.
(11) UCITS should be explicitly permitted, as part of their general investment policy and/or for hedging purposes in order to reach a set financial target or the risk profile indicated in the prospectus, to invest in financial derivative instruments. In order to ensure investor protection, it is necessary to limit the maximum potential exposure relating to derivative instruments so that it does not exceed the total net value of the UCITS's portfolio. In order to ensure constant awareness of the risks and commitments arising from derivative transactions and to check compliance with investment limits, these risks and commitments will have to be measured and monitored on an ongoing basis. Finally, in order to ensure investor protection through disclosure, UCITS should describe their strategies, techniques and investment limits governing their derivative operations.
(12) With regard to over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives, additional requirements should be set in terms of the eligibility of counterparties and instruments, liquidity and ongoing assessment of the position. The purpose of such additional requirements is to ensure an adequate level of investor protection, close to that which they obtain when they acquire derivatives dealt in on regulated markets.
(13) Operations in derivatives may never be used to circumvent the principles and rules set out in this Directive. With regard to OTC derivatives, additional risk-spreading rules should apply to exposures to a single counterparty or group of counterparties.
(14) Some portfolio management techniques for collective investment undertakings investing primarily in shares and/or debt securities are based on the replication of stock indices and/or debt-security indices. It is desirable to permit UCITS to replicate well-known and recognised stock indices and/or debt-security indices. It may therefore be necessary to introduce more flexible risk-spreading rules for UCITS investing in shares and/or debt securities to this end.
(15) Collective investment undertakings falling within the scope of this Directive should not be used for purposes other than the collective investment of the money raised from the public according to the rules laid down in this Directive. In the cases identified by this Directive a UCITS may have subsidiaries only when necessary to carry out effectively on behalf of that UCITS certain activities, also defined in this Directive. It is necessary to ensure an effective supervision of UCITS. Therefore the establishment of a subsidiary of a UCITS in a third country should be permitted only in the cases and under the conditions identified in the Directive. The general obligation to act solely in the interests of unit-holders and, in particular, the objective of increasing cost efficiencies, never justify a UCITS undertaking measures which may hinder the competent authorities from exercising effectively their supervisory functions.
(16) There is a need to ensure the free cross-border marketing of the units of a wider range of collective investment undertakings, while providing a uniform minimum level of investor protection. Therefore, only a binding Community Directive laying down agreed minimum standards can achieve the desired objectives. This Directive effects only the minimum harmonisation required and does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve the objectives pursued in accordance with the third paragraph of Article 5 of the Treaty.
(17) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Directive should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(6).
(18) The Commission may consider proposing codification in due course after the adoption of the proposals,
HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:

8. Article 20 shall be deleted;
9. Article 21 shall be replaced by the following: "Article 21
1. The management or investment company must employ a risk-management process which enables it to monitor and measure at any time the risk of the positions and their contribution to the overall risk profile of the portfolio; it must employ a process for accurate and independent assessment of the value of OTC derivative instruments. It must communicate to the competent authorities regularly and in accordance with the detailed rules they shall define, the types of derivative instruments, the underlying risks, the quantitative limits and the methods which are chosen in order to estimate the risks associated with transactions in derivative instruments regarding each managed UCITS.
2. The Member States may authorise UCITS to employ techniques and instruments relating to transferable securities and money market instruments under the conditions and within the limits which they lay down provided that such techniques and instruments are used for the purpose of efficient portfolio management. When these operations concern the use of derivative instruments, these conditions and limits shall conform to the provisions laid down in this Directive.
Under no circumstances shall these operations cause the UCITS to diverge from its investment objectives as laid down in the UCITS' fund rules, instruments of incorporation or prospectus.
3. A UCITS shall ensure that its global exposure relating to derivative instruments does not exceed the total net value of its portfolio.
The exposure is calculated taking into account the current value of the underlying assets, the counterparty risk, future market movements and the time available to liquidate the positions. This shall also apply to the following subparagraphs.
A UCITS may invest, as a part of its investment policy and within the limit laid down in Article 22(5), in financial derivative instruments provided that the exposure to the underlying assets does not exceed in aggregate the investment limits laid down in Article 22. The Member States may allow that, when a UCITS invests in index-based financial derivative instruments, these investments do not have to be combined to the limits laid down in Article 22.
When a transferable security or money market instrument embeds a derivative, the latter must be taken into account when complying with the requirements of this Article.
4. The Member States shall send the Commission full information and any subsequent changes in their regulation concerning the methods used to calculate the risk exposures mentioned in paragraph 3, including the risk exposure to a counterparty in OTC derivative transactions, no later than 13 February 2004. The Commission shall forward that information to the other Member States. Such information will be the subject of exchanges of views within the Contact Committee in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 53(4).";
10. Article 22 shall be replaced by the following: "Article 22
1. A UCITS may invest no more than 5 % of its assets in transferable securities or money market instruments issued by the same body. A UCITS may not invest more than 20 % of its assets in deposits made with the same body.
The risk exposure to a counterparty of the UCITS in an OTC derivative transaction may not exceed:
- 10 % of its assets when the counterpart is a credit institution referred to in Article 19(1)(f), or
- 5 % of its assets, in other cases.
2. Member States may raise the 5 % limit laid down in the first sentence of paragraph 1 to a maximum of 10 %. However, the total value of the transferable securities and the money market instruments held by the UCITS in the issuing bodies in each of which it invests more than 5 % of its assets must not then exceed 40 % of the value of its assets. This limitation does not apply to deposits and OTC derivative transactions made with financial institutions subject to prudential supervision.
Notwithstanding the individual limits laid down in paragraph 1, a UCITS may not combine:
- investments in transferable securities or money market instruments issued by,
- deposits made with, and/or
4. Member States may raise the 5 % limit laid down in the first sentence of paragraph 1 to a maximum of 25 % in the case of certain bonds when these are issued by a credit institution which has its registered office in a Member State and is subject by law to special public supervision designed to protect bond-holders. In particular, sums deriving from the issue of these bonds must be invested in conformity with the law in assets which, during the whole period of validity of the bonds, are capable of covering claims attaching to the bonds and which, in the event of failure of the issuer, would be used on a priority basis for the reimbursement of the principal and payment of the accrued interest.
When a UCITS invests more than 5 % of its assets in the bonds referred to in the first subparagraph and issued by one issuer, the total value of these investments may not exceed 80 % of the value of the assets of the UCITS.
The Member States shall send the Commission a list of the aforementioned categories of bonds together with the categories of issuers authorised, in accordance with the laws and supervisory arrangements mentioned in the first subparagraph, to issue bonds complying with the criteria set out above. A notice specifying the status of the guarantees offered shall be attached to these lists. The Commission shall immediately forward that information to the other Member States together with any comments which it considers appropriate, and shall make the information available to the public. Such communications may be the subject of exchanges of views within the Contact Committee in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 53(4).
5. The transferable securities and money market instruments referred to in paragraphs 3 and 4 shall not be taken into account for the purpose of applying the limit of 40 % referred to in paragraph 2.
The limits provided for in paragraphs 1, 2, 3 and 4 may not be combined, and thus investments in transferable securities or money market instruments issued by the same body or in deposits or derivative instruments made with this body carried out in accordance with paragraphs 1, 2, 3 and 4 shall under no circumstances exceed in total 35 % of the assets of the UCITS.
Companies which are included in the same group for the purposes of consolidated accounts, as defined in accordance with Directive 83/349/EEC(8) or in accordance with recognised international accounting rules, are regarded as a single body for the purpose of calculating the limits contained in this Article.
Member States may allow cumulative investment in transferable securities and money market instruments within the same group up to a limit of 20 %.";
11. the following Article shall be inserted: "Article 22a
1. Without prejudice to the limits laid down in Article 25, the Member States may raise the limits laid down in Article 22 to a maximum of 20 % for investment in shares and/or debt securities issued by the same body when, according to the fund rules or instruments of incorporation, the aim of the UCITS' investment policy is to replicate the composition of a certain stock or debt securities index which is recognised by the competent authorities, on the following basis:
- its composition is sufficiently diversified,
- the index represents an adequate benchmark for the market to which it refers,
- it is published in an appropriate manner.
2. Member States may raise the limit laid down in paragraph 1 to a maximum of 35 % where that proves to be justified by exceptional market conditions in particular in regulated markets where certain transferable securities or money market instruments are highly dominant. The investment up to this limit is only permitted for a single issuer.";
12. in Article 23(1), the words "and money market instruments" shall be added after the words "transferable securities";

Commission Regulation (EC) No 70/2001
of 12 January 2001
on the application of Articles 87 and 88 of the EC Treaty to State aid to small and medium-sized enterprises
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 994/98 of 7 May 1998 on the application of Articles 92 and 93 of the Treaty establishing the European Community to certain categories of horizontal State aid(1), and in particular points (a)(i) and (b) of Article 1(1) thereof,
Having published a draft of this Regulation(2),
Having consulted the Advisory Committee on State Aid,
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 994/98 empowers the Commission to declare, in accordance with Article 87 of the Treaty, that under certain conditions aid to small and medium-sized enterprises is compatible with the common market and not subject to the notification requirement of Article 88(3) of the Treaty.
(2) Regulation (EC) No 994/98 also empowers the Commission to declare, in accordance with Article 87 of the Treaty, that aid that complies with the map approved by the Commission for each Member State for the grant of regional aid is compatible with the common market and is not subject to the notification requirement of Article 88(3) of the Treaty.
(3) The Commission has applied Articles 87 and 88 of the Treaty to small and medium-sized enterprises in and outside assisted areas in numerous decisions and has also stated its policy, most recently in the Community guidelines on State aid for small and medium-sized enterprises(3) and in the guidelines on national regional aid(4). In the light of the Commission's considerable experience in applying those Articles to small and medium-sized enterprises and in the light of the general texts relating to small and medium-sized enterprises and to regional aid issued by the Commission on the basis of those provisions, it is appropriate, with a view to ensuring efficient supervision and simplifying administration without weakening Commission monitoring, that the Commission should make use of the powers conferred by Regulation (EC) No 994/98.
(4) This Regulation is without prejudice to the possibility for Member States of notifying aid to small and medium-sized enterprises. Such notifications will be assessed by the Commission in particular in the light of the criteria set out in this Regulation. The guidelines on State aid for small and medium-sized enterprises should be abolished from the date of entry into force of this Regulation, since their contents are replaced by this Regulation.
(5) Small and medium-sized enterprises play a decisive role in job creation and, more generally, act as a factor of social stability and economic drive. However, their development may be limited by market imperfections. They often have difficulties in obtaining capital or credit, given the risk-shy nature of certain financial markets and the limited guarantees that they may be able to offer. Their limited resources may also restrict their access to information, notably regarding new technology and potential markets. Having regard to those considerations, the purpose of the aid exempted by this Regulation should be to facilitate the development of the economic activities of small and medium-sized enterprises, provided that such aid does not adversely affect trading conditions to an extent contrary to the common interest.
(6) This Regulation should exempt any aid that meets all the relevant requirements of this Regulation, and any aid scheme, provided that any aid that could be granted under such scheme meets all the relevant requirements of this Regulation. With a view to ensuring efficient supervision and simplifying administration without weakening Commission monitoring, aid schemes and individual grants outside any aid scheme should contain an express reference to this Regulation.
(7) This Regulation should apply without prejudice to special rules in regulations and directives concerning State aid in certain sectors, such as currently exist for shipbuilding, and should not apply to agriculture and fisheries and aquaculture.
(8) In order to eliminate differences that might give rise to distortions of competition, in order to facilitate coordination between different Community and national initiatives concerning small and medium-sized enterprises, and for reasons of administrative clarity and legal certainty, the definition of "small and medium-sized enterprises" used in this Regulation should be that laid down in Commission Recommendation 96/280/EC of 3 April 1996 concerning the definition of small and medium-sized enterprises(5). That definition was also used in the Community guidelines on State aid for small and medium-sized enterprises(6).
(9) In accordance with the established practice of the Commission, and with a view to better ensuring that aid is proportionate and limited to the amount necessary, thresholds should be expressed in terms of aid intensities in relation to a set of eligible costs, rather than in terms of maximum aid amounts.
(10) In order to determine whether or not aid is compatible with the common market pursuant to this Regulation, it is necessary to take into consideration the aid intensity and thus the aid amount expressed as a grant equivalent. The calculation of the grant equivalent of aid payable in several instalments and aid in the form of a soft loan requires the use of market interest rates prevailing at the time of grant. With a view to a uniform, transparent, and simple application of the State aid rules, the market rates for the purposes of this Regulation should be deemed to be the reference rates, provided that, in the case of a soft loan, the loan is backed by normal security and does not involve abnormal risk. The reference rates should be those which are periodically fixed by the Commission on the basis of objective criteria and published in the Official Journal of the European Communities and on the Internet.
(11) Having regard to the differences between small enterprises and medium-sized enterprises, different ceilings of aid intensity should be set for small enterprises and for medium-sized enterprises.
(12) The ceilings of aid intensity should be fixed, in the light of the Commission's experience, at a level that strikes the appropriate balance between minimising distortions of competition in the aided sector and the objective of facilitating the development of the economic activities of small and medium-sized enterprises.
(13) It is appropriate to establish further conditions that should be fulfilled by any aid scheme or individual aid exempted by this Regulation. Having regard to Article 87(3)(c) of the Treaty, such aid should not normally have the sole effect of continuously or periodically reducing the operating costs which the beneficiary would normally have to bear, and should be proportionate to the handicaps that have to be overcome in order to secure the socioeconomic benefits deemed to be in the Community interest. It is therefore appropriate to limit the scope of this Regulation to aid granted in relation to certain tangible and intangible investments, certain services supplied to beneficiaries and certain other activities. In the light of Community overcapacity in the transport sector, with the exception of railway rolling stock, eligible investment costs for enterprises having their main economic activity in the transport sector should not include transport means and equipment.
(14) This Regulation should exempt aid to small and medium-sized enterprises regardless of location. Investment and job creation can contribute to the economic development of less favoured regions in the Community. Small and medium-sized enterprises in those regions suffer from both the structural disadvantage of the location and the difficulties deriving from their size. It is therefore appropriate that small and medium-sized enterprises in assisted regions should benefit from higher ceilings.
(15) In order not to favour the capital factor of an investment over the labour factor, provision should be made for the possibility of measuring aid to investment on the basis of either the costs of the investment or the costs of new employment linked to the carrying-out of the investment project.
(16) In the light of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures(7), this Regulation should not exempt export aid or aid favouring domestic over imported products. Aid towards the costs of participation in trade fairs or of studies or consultancy services needed for the launch of a new or existing product on a new market does not normally constitute export aid.
(17) Having regard to the need to strike the appropriate balance between minimising distortions of competition in the aided sector and the objectives of this Regulation, it should not exempt individual aid grants which exceed a fixed maximum amount, whether or not made under an aid scheme exempted by this Regulation.
(18) In order to ensure that the aid is necessary and acts as an incentive to develop certain activities, this Regulation should not exempt aid for activities in which the beneficiary would already engage under market conditions alone.
(19) This Regulation should not exempt aid cumulated with other State aid, including aid granted by national, regional or local authorities, or with Community assistance, in relation to the same eligible costs, when such cumulation exceeds the thresholds fixed in this Regulation.
(20) In order to ensure transparency and effective monitoring, in accordance with Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 994/98, it is appropriate to establish a standard format in which Member States should provide the Commission with summary information whenever, in pursuance of this Regulation, an aid scheme is implemented or an individual aid outside such schemes is granted, with a view to publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities. For the same reasons, it is appropriate to establish rules concerning the records that Member States should keep regarding the aid exempted by this Regulation. For the purposes of the annual report to be submitted to the Commission by Member States, it is appropriate for the Commission to establish its specific requirements, including, in view of the wide availability of the necessary technology, information in computerised form.
(21) Having regard to the Commission's experience in this area, and in particular the frequency with which it is generally necessary to revise State aid policy, it is appropriate to limit the period of application of this Regulation. Should this Regulation expire without being extended, aid schemes already exempted by this Regulation should continue to be exempted for six months,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:

5. In cases where the aid is calculated on the basis of the investment's costs, the eligible costs of tangible investment shall be the costs relating to investment in land, buildings, machinery and equipment. In the transport sector, except for railway rolling stock, transport means and transport equipment shall not be included in the eligible costs. The eligible costs of intangible investment shall be the costs of acquisition of the technology.
6. In cases where the aid is calculated on the basis of jobs created, the amount of the aid shall be expressed as a percentage of the wage costs over a period of two years relating to the employment created under the following conditions:

Article 7
Necessity for the aid
This Regulation shall only exempt aid if, before work on the aided project is started:
- either an application for aid has been submitted to the Member State by the beneficiary, or
- the Member State has adopted legal provisions establishing a legal right to aid according to objective criteria and without further exercise of discretion by the Member State.
Article 8
Cumulation
1. The aid ceilings fixed in Articles 4, 5 and 6 shall apply regardless of whether the support for the aided project is financed entirely from State resources or is partly financed by the Community.
2. Aid exempted by this Regulation shall not be cumulated with any other State aid within the meaning of Article 87(1) of the Treaty, or with other Community funding, in relation to the same eligible costs, if such cumulation would result in an aid intensity exceeding that fixed by this Regulation.

Such records shall contain all information necessary to establish that the conditions for exemption, as laid down in this Regulation, are fulfilled, including information on the status of the company as an SME. Member States shall keep a record regarding an individual aid for 10 years from the date on which it was granted, and regarding an aid scheme, for 10 years from the date on which the last individual aid was granted under such scheme. On written request, the Member State concerned shall provide the Commission, within a period of 20 working days or such longer period as may be fixed in the request, with all the information which the Commission considers necessary to assess whether the conditions of this Regulation have been complied with.
3.

Commission Regulation (EC) No 283/2001
of 9 February 2001
amending Regulation (EC) No 562/2000 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 as regards the buying-in of beef, and Regulation (EC) No 2734/2000
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in beef and veal(1), and in particular Article 47(8) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 2734/2000 of 14 December 2000 amending Regulation (EEC) No 1627/89 on the buying-in of beef by invitation to tender and derogating from or amending Regulation (EC) No 562/2000 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 as regards the buying-in of beef(2), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 3/2001(3), introduces a number of amendments to or derogations from Commission Regulation (EC) No 562/2000(4) to address the exceptional situation on the market resulting from recent events relating to bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE).
(2) In view of this exceptional market situation and to improve the effectiveness of the intervention measures provided for in Regulation (EC) No 2734/2000, Article 4(2)(g) of Regulation (EC) No 562/2000 should be derogated from as regards the maximum weight of carcases by not setting any weight limit for the two invitations to tender in February 2001 and by increasing the weight to 430 kg for the remaining invitations to tender in the first quarter of 2001, while still allowing the purchase of heavier animals but at a purchase price equal to the maximum authorised weight.
(3) Regulation (EC) No 2734/2000 should therefore be amended.
(4) Since products bought in can also be sold after 1 January 2002, when the system of compulsory labelling based on origin laid down by Regulation (EC) No 1760/2000 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 July 2000 establishing a system for the identification and registration of bovine animals and regarding the labelling of beef and beef products and repealing Regulation (EC) No 820/97(5) will apply, the labels of products intended for intervention pursuant to contracts concluded on or after 12 February 2001 (i.e. with effect from the first invitation to tender in the month of February) should be required to include an indication of the country or countries of birth and fattening of the animals concerned, in accordance with Article 13(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1760/2000, together with the indications laid down in Article 2(2) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1825/2000(6) laying down detailed rules for the application of Regulation (EC) No 1760/2000, as appropriate.
(5) Annex III of Regulation (EC) No 562/2000 sets out the provisions applying to carcases, half-carcases and quarters that can be bought in. With a view to falling into line with current commercial practice, the description of the half-carcase in that Annex should be amended by introducing some margin of tolerance in the description.
(6) Regulation (EC) No 562/2000 should be amended accordingly.
(7) In view of the way the situation is developing, this Regulation should enter into force immediately.
(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Beef and Veal,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
Article 6(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2734/2000 is replaced by the following:
"1. Notwithstanding Article 4(2)(g) of Regulation (EC) No 562/2000, the maximum carcase weight referred to in that Article shall be 430 kg. However:
- no maximum carcase limit shall apply to the two invitations to tender in February 2001,
- for the remaining invitations to tender in the first quarter of 2001, carcases of a weight greater than 430 kg may be bought in but the purchase price for them shall be that for this maximum weight."
Article 2
Regulation (EC) No 562/2000 is amended as follows:
1. Article 4(3)(d) is replaced by the following:
"(d) labelled in accordance with the system introduced by European Parliament and Council Regulation (EC) No 1760/2000(7) and including, in the case of contracts concluded on or after 12 February 2001, the indications laid down in Article 13(5) of that Regulation."
2. Point 2(b) of Annex III is replaced by the following:
"(b) half-carcase: the product obtained by separating the carcase as referred to in (a) symmetrically through the middle of the cervical, dorsal, lumbar and sacral vertebrae and through the middle of the sternum and the ischiopubic symphysis. During carcase processing, the dorsal and lumbar vertebrae must not be seriously dislocated; associated muscles and tendons must not show any serious damage from saws or knives."
Article 3
This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
Commission Regulation (EC) No 749/2001
of 18 April 2001
amending Annex II to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 laying down a Community procedure for the establishment of maximum residue limits of veterinary medicinal products in foodstuffs of animal origin
(Text with EEA relevance)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 of 26 June 1990 laying down a Community procedure for the establishment of maximum residue limits of veterinary medicinal products in foodstuffs of animal origin(1), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2908/2000(2), and in particular Articles 7 and 8 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) In accordance with Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90, maximum residue limits must be established progressively for all pharmacologically active substances which are used within the Community in veterinary medicinal products intended for administration to food-producing animals.
(2) Maximum residue limits should be established only after the examination within the Committee for Veterinary Medicinal Products of all the relevant information concerning the safety of residues of the substance concerned for the consumer of foodstuffs of animal origin and the impact of residues on the industrial processing of foodstuffs.
(3) In establishing maximum residue limits for residues of veterinary medicinal products in foodstuffs of animal origin, it is necessary to specify the animal species in which residues may be present, the levels which may be present in each of the relevant meat tissues obtained from the treated animal (target tissue) and the nature of the residue whch is relevant for the monitoring of residues (marker residue).
(4) For the control of residues, as provided for in appropriate Community legislation, maximum residue limits should usually be established for the target tissues of liver or kidney. However, the liver and kidney are frequently removed from carcases moving in international trade, and maximum residue limits should therefore also always be established for muscle or fat tissues.
(5) In the case of veterinary medicinal products intended for use in laying birds, lactating animals or honey bees, maximum residue limits must also be established for eggs, milk or honey.
(6) Thiamylal and thiopental sodium should be inserted into Annex II to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90.
(7) An adequate period should be allowed before the entry into force of this Regulation in order to allow Member States to make any adjustment which may be necessary to the authorisations to place the veterinary medicinal products concerned on the market which have been granted in accordance with Council Directive 81/851/EEC(3), as last amended by Commission Directive 2000/37/EC(4), to take account of the provisions of this Regulation.
(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Veterinary Medicinal Products,
HAS ADOPTED THE FOLLOWING REGULATION:
Article 1
Annex II to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 is hereby amended as set out in the Annex hereto.
Article 2
This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
Commission Regulation (EC) No 939/2001
of 14 May 2001
laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 104/2000 as regards the grant of flat-rate aid for certain fishery products
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 104/2000 of 17 December 1999 on the common organisation of the markets in fishery and aquaculture products(1), and in particular Article 24(8) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 24 of Regulation (EC) No 104/2000, which repealed Council Regulation (EEC) No 3759/92(2) with effect from 1 January 2001, provides for flat-rate aid to be granted under certain conditions to producer organisations which withdraw from the market products listed in Annex IV to that Regulation.
(2) In the interests of harmonisation and simplification, the procedures required in the context of flat-rate aid should be the same as those which apply to financial compensation and carry-over aid, as set out in Commission Regulation (EC) No 2509/2000 of 15 November 2000 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 104/2000 as regards granting financial compensation for withdrawals of certain fishery products(3) and Commission Regulation (EC) No 2814/2000 of 21 December 2000 laying down the detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 104/2000 as regards the grant of carry-over aid for certain fishery products(4). The conditions for granting flat-rate aid should therefore be established on that basis and Commission Regulation (EEC) No 4176/88 of 28 December 1988 laying down detailed rules of application for the granting of flat-rate aid for certain fisheries products(5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 3516/93(6), should be repealed.
(3) Article 6(1) of Council Regulation (EC) No 2406/96 of 26 November 1996 laying down common marketing standards for certain fishery products(7), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2578/2000(8), provides that products that are classified as category B are ineligible for the financial assistance granted in respect of withdrawal as provided for in the common market organisation. Given that only Extra, "E" and "A" quality products are eligible for the flat-rate aid described in Article 24 of Regulation (EC) No 104/2000, the calculation of the quantities eligible for this aid should be based on these categories of products only.
(4) The conditions to be satisfied by producer organisations in the context of the flat-rate aid scheme should be determined.
(5) The flat-rate aid may be paid only at the end of the fishing year. However, provision should be made for the possibility of granting advances subject to the lodging of a security.
(6) The Member States should be authorised to fix the standard value used in calculating the flat-rate aid broken down according to the destination of the products withdrawn as provided for in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1501/83 of 9 June 1983 on the disposal of certain fishery products which have been the subject of measures to stabilise the market(9), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1106/90(10).
(7) In order to help guarantee product quality and the disposal of these products on the market, the minimum conditions applicable to processing, and the conditions relating to storage and the re-release onto the market of the processed products should be determined.
(8) The recipients of aid should keep a stock record containing the figures for releases onto the market, withdrawals from the market and amounts carried over each month (in kilograms) to increase the efficiency of checks and should supply this information to the Member State. It is sufficient for the purposes of good management of the mechanism to require stock records during the minimum storage periods.
(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Fishery Products,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
CHAPTER I
General provisions
Article 1
Article 2
Flat-rate aid shall be paid to the producer organisation concerned only once the competent authorities in the Member State in question have satisfied themselves that the quantities in respect of which the aid is applied for do not exceed the limit given in Article 24(5) of Regulation (EC) No 104/2000.
CHAPTER II
Conditions for granting the flat-rate aid referred to in Article 24(2) of Regulation (EC) No 104/2000 (hereinafter referred to as "flat-rate compensation")

The standard value shall be fixed at the beginning of the fishing year and shall be identical for all the producer organisations recognised by the Member State concerned, using as a basis the average receipts from disposal via the outlets for the Member States concerned over the six months preceding the fixing of that value. That level shall be amended if significant and lasting changes in receipts are noted on the market of the Member State concerned.
CHAPTER III
Conditions for granting the flat-rate aid referred to in Article 24(4) of Regulation (EC) No 104/2000 (hereinafter referred to as "flat-rate premium")
Article 5
1. The amount of the flat-rate premium shall be fixed before the beginning of each fishing year in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 38(2) of Regulation (EC) No 104/2000. The amount shall be fixed per unit weight, to be applied to the net weight of each product listed in Annex IV to that Regulation.
2. The amount of the flat-rate premium shall be calculated on the basis of the real technical and financial costs of operations required for the stabilisation and storage of the products in question as recorded in the Community during the previous fishing year.
3. The following shall be considered as technical costs:
(a) energy costs;
(b) labour costs relating to storage and release from storage;
(c) cost of materials for direct packaging;
(d) processing costs (ingredients);
(e) cost of transport from place of landing to place of processing.
4. The financial costs shall be a flat-rate sum of EUR 10 per tonne for 2001. Thereafter the flat-rate sum shall be adjusted each year using the interest rate set annually in accordance with Article 5 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1883/78(11).
5. The level of the flat-rate premium fixed for the fishing year concerned shall apply to products entering storage during that year, irrespective of the end of the storage period.
Article 6
Article 3(1) and (2) and Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 2814/2000 shall apply mutatis mutandis to the grant of the flat-rate premium.
Article 7
The flat-rate premium shall be paid to the producer organisation concerned only once the competent authorities in the Member State concerned have satisfied themselves that the quantities in respect of which the premium is applied for have been either processed and stored, or preserved, and subsequently placed back on the market, in accordance with Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 2814/2000.
CHAPTER IV
Final provisions
Article 8
1. Applications for payment of the flat-rate aid shall be submitted by the producer organisation concerned to the competent authorities of the Member State not later than four months after the end of the fishing year concerned. They shall include at least the information set out in the Annex.

3. The amount of the advance payment or payments shall be determined on the basis of the provisional ratio of the quantities withdrawn to the quantities put up for sale during the period concerned. The calculation of the amount shall be adjusted two months after the month concerned on the basis of the transactions actually carried out and reported using the model set out in the Annex.
4. The national authorities shall pay the flat-rate aid within eight months of the end of the fishing year at the latest. Each Member State shall notify the other Member States and the Commission of the name and address of the body designated to pay the flat-rate aid.
Article 9
1. The Member States shall introduce a system of checks to verify that the information given in applications for payment corresponds to the quantities actually put up for sale and withdrawn from the market by the producer organisation concerned.
2. Producer organisations shall ensure that the beneficiaries of the aid keep a stock record in accordance with the model set out in the Annex.
3. Producer organisations shall communicate the date, species and quantity of products withdrawn or carried over to the Member State each month.
Article 10
The Member States shall inform the Commission of the measures taken under this Regulation as soon as they are adopted, and in any case before 1 July 2001. They shall inform the Commission of the existing measures in the field covered by Article 9(1) before 1 July 2001.
Article 11
Regulation (EEC) No 4176/88 is repealed.
Article 12
Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council
of 22 May 2001
laying down rules for the prevention, control and eradication of certain transmissible spongiform encephalopathies
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 152(4)(b) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee(2),
Having consulted the Committee of the Regions,
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty(3),
Whereas:
(1) Several distinct transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) have for a number of years been recognised as occurring separately in humans and animals. Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) was first recognised in bovine animals in 1986 and in the following years was recognised as occurring in other species of animal. A new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD) was described in 1996. Evidence continues to grow of the similarity between the BSE agent and that of the new variant of Creutzfeld-Jakob Disease.
(2) Since 1990 the Community has adopted a series of measures to protect human and animal health from the risk of BSE. Those measures have been based on the safeguard provisions of Directives on animal-health measures. It is appropriate, in view of the magnitude of the risk posed to human and animal health by certain TSEs, to adopt specific rules for their prevention, control and eradication.
(3) This Regulation directly concerns public health and is relevant to the functioning of the internal market. It covers products which are included in Annex I to the Treaty as well as products which are not. Consequently, it is appropriate to choose Article 152(4)(b) of the Treaty as the legal basis.
(4) The Commission has obtained scientific opinions, in particular from the Scientific Steering Committee and the Scientific Committee on Veterinary Measures relating to Public Health, on several aspects of TSEs. Those opinions include advice on measures to reduce the potential risk for humans and animals resulting from exposure to infected animal products.
(5) These rules should apply to the production and placing on the market of live animals and products of animal origin. However, it is not necessary for them to apply to cosmetic or medicinal products, medical devices or their starting materials or intermediate products, for which other specific rules, in particular on the non-use of specified risk material, apply. Nor should they apply to products of animal origin which do not pose a risk to animal or human health since they are intended for purposes other than the production of food, feed or fertiliser. It is appropriate to ensure that products of animal origin excluded from the scope of this Regulation are kept separate from those covered by it unless they meet at least the same health standards as the latter.
(6) Provision should be made for safeguard measures to be taken by the Commission in cases where a risk from a TSE has not been adequately addressed by the competent authority of a Member State or third country.
(7) A procedure should be established for the determination of the epidemiological status of a Member State, a third country and of one of their regions, hereinafter referred to as "countries or regions" with respect to BSE, on the basis of the incident propagation and human exposure risk, using information available. Member States and third countries which choose not to apply for their status to be determined should be classified in a category by the Commission on the basis of all the information available to it.
(8) Member States should institute education programmes for those involved in the prevention and control of TSEs, as well as for veterinarians, farmers and workers involved in the transportation, marketing and slaughter of farm animals.
(9) Member States should carry out an annual programme for monitoring BSE and scrapie and should inform the Commission and the other Member States of the results and of the emergence of any other TSE.
(10) Certain ruminant tissues should be designated as specified risk material on the basis of the pathogenesis of TSEs and the epidemiological status of the country or region of origin or residence of the animal concerned. The specified risk material should be removed and disposed of in a manner which avoids any risk to human or animal health. In particular, it should not be placed on the market to be used in the production of food, feed or fertiliser. However, provision should be made for an equivalent level of health protection by means of a screening test for TSEs carried out on individual animals as soon as it has been fully validated. Slaughter techniques presenting a risk of causing brain material to contaminate other tissues should not be permitted in countries or regions other than those presenting the lowest risk of BSE.
(11) Measures should be taken to prevent the transmission of TSEs to humans or animals by prohibiting the feeding of certain categories of animal protein to certain categories of animal, and by prohibiting the use of certain ruminant materials in food. Those prohibitions should be proportionate to the risks involved.
(12) The suspected presence of any TSE in any animal should be notified to the competent authority, which should immediately take all appropriate measures, including placing the suspect animal under movement restrictions while awaiting the results of the investigation or having it slaughtered under official supervision. If the competent authority cannot exclude the possibility of a TSE, it should have the appropriate investigations carried out and should keep the carcasse under official supervision until a diagnosis has been made.
(13) In the event of official confirmation of the presence of a TSE, the competent authority should take all the necessary measures, including having the carcasse destroyed, carrying out an investigation in order to identify all animals at risk and placing movement restrictions on the animals and the products of animal origin identified as such. Owners should be compensated, as soon as possible, for the loss of animals and products of animal origin destroyed pursuant to this Regulation.
(14) Member States should draw up contingency plans for the national measures to be implemented in the event of an outbreak of BSE. Those plans should be approved by the Commission. Provision should be made for extending this provision to TSEs other than BSE.
(15) Provisions should be laid down covering the placing on the market of certain live animals and products of animal origin. Existing Community rules on the identification and registration of bovine animals provide for a system enabling the animals to be traced back to the dam and herd of origin in accordance with international standards. Equivalent guarantees should be provided for bovine animals imported from third countries. The animals and products of animal origin covered by Community rules, moving in intra-Community trade or imported from third countries, should be accompanied by the certificates required by the said rules, supplemented as appropriate in accordance with this Regulation.
(16) The placing on the market of certain products of animal origin derived from bovine animals in high risk regions should be prohibited. However, that prohibition should not apply to certain products of animal origin produced under controlled conditions from animals which can be demonstrated not to pose a high risk of infection with a TSE.
(17) It is necessary, in order to ensure that the rules concerning the prevention, control and eradication of TSEs are observed, for samples to be taken for laboratory testing on the basis of an established protocol which would give a full epidemiological picture of the situation as regards TSE. In order to guarantee uniform testing procedures and results, national and Community Reference Laboratories and reliable scientific methods, including rapid tests specifically for TSEs, should be established. Rapid tests should be used as far as possible.
(18) Community inspections should be carried out in the Member States in order to ensure uniform implementation of the requirements concerning the prevention, control and eradication of TSEs and provision should also be made for the implementation of audit procedures. In order to ensure that guarantees equivalent to those applied by the Community are provided by third countries upon import into the Community of live animals and products of animal origin, Community on-the-spot inspections and audits should be carried out in order to verify that the import conditions are met by exporting third countries.
(19) Trade measures for TSEs should be based on international standards, guidelines or recommendations, where they exist. However, scientifically justified measures resulting in a higher level of health protection may be adopted if measures based on the relevant international standards, guidelines or recommendations would not achieve the appropriate level of health protection.
(20) This Regulation should be re-examined as new scientific information becomes available.
(21) The necessary transitional measures in particular for regulating the use of specified risk material should be provided for in the framework of this Regulation.
(22) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedure for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(4).
(23) In order to implement this Regulation, procedures should be laid down establishing close and effective cooperation between the Commission and the Member States within the Standing Veterinary Committee, the Standing Committee on Feedingstuffs, and the Standing Committee on Foodstuffs.
(24) Given that the provisions for the implementation of this Regulation are general measures within the meaning of Article 2 of Decision 1999/468/EC, they should be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure laid down in Article 5 of that Decision,
HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:

CHAPTER II
DETERMINATION OF BSE STATUS
Article 5
Classification
1. The BSE status of a Member State, of a third country, or of one of their regions (hereinafter referred to as "countries or regions") may be determined only on the basis of the criteria set out in Annex II, Chapter A, and the outcome of a risk analysis on the basis of all the potential factors for the appearance of bovine spongiform encephalopathy as defined in Annex II, Chapter B, and their development over time.
Member States, and third countries wishing to be retained on the list of third countries approved for the export to the Community of the live animals or of the products covered by this Regulation, shall submit to the Commission an application for their BSE status to be determined, accompanied by the relevant information on the criteria set out in Annex II, Chapter A, and on the potential risk factors specified in Annex II, Chapter B, and their development over time.
2. A decision on each application, placing the Member State or third country or region of the Member State or third country which submitted the application in one of the categories defined in Annex II, Chapter C, shall be adopted, taking account of the criteria and potential risk factors set out in paragraph 1, in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 24(2).
This decision shall be taken within six months of the submission of the application and of the relevant information referred to in the second subparagraph of paragraph 1. If the Commission finds that the supporting evidence does not include the information laid down in Annex II, Chapters A and B, it shall ask for additional information to be provided within a period to be specified. The final decision shall then be taken within six months of the submission of all information.
After the International Office of Epizootic Diseases (OIE) has established a procedure for the classification of countries by category and if it has placed the applicant country in one of those categories, a re-assessment of the Community categorisation of the country concerned in accordance with the first subparagraph of this paragraph may be decided, if appropriate, in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 24(2).
3. If the Commission finds that the information submitted by a Member State or a third country pursuant to Annex II, Chapters A and B, is insufficient or unclear, it may, in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 24(2), determine the BSE status of the Member State or third country concerned on the basis of a full risk analysis.
Such a risk analysis must include a conclusive statistical survey of the epidemiological situation regarding TSEs in the applicant Member State or third country, on the basis of the use, in a screening procedure, of rapid tests. The Commission shall take into account the classification criteria used by the OIE.
The rapid tests shall be approved for that purpose in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 24(2) and entered on a list set out in Annex X, Chapter C, point 4.
Such screening procedure may also be used by Member States or third countries which wish to have the classification they carried out on that basis approved by the Commission - in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 24(2).
The cost of such screening procedure shall be borne by the Member State or third country concerned.
4. Member States or third countries which have not submitted an application in accordance with paragraph 1 within six months of 1 July 2001 shall, with respect to the dispatch from their territory of live animals and products of animal origin, be considered as countries in category 5, referred to in Annex II, Chapter C, until they have submitted such an application.
5. Member States shall notify the Commission as soon as possible of any epidemiological evidence or other information which might lead to a change in BSE status, in particular the results of the monitoring programmes provided for in Article 6.
6. The retention of a third country on one of the lists provided for by Community rules for the purpose of being allowed to export to the Community live animals and products of animal origin for which this Regulation provides specific rules shall be decided upon under the procedure laid down in Article 24(2) and shall be made conditional - in the light of the information available or where a TSE is presumed to be present - on the information provided for in paragraph 1 being supplied. In the event of refusal to supply the said information within three months of the date of the Commission's request, the provisions of paragraph 4 of this Article shall apply until this information has been submitted and evaluated in accordance with paragraphs 2 or 3.
The eligibility of third countries to export to the Community live animals, or products of animal origin for which this Regulation provides specific rules, under conditions based on their category as established by the Commission, shall be conditional upon their undertaking to notify the latter in writing as soon as possible of any epidemiological or other evidence which might lead to a change in BSE status.
7. A decision may be taken, under the procedure laid down in Article 24(2), to change the BSE classification of a Member State or third country, or of one of its regions, in accordance with the results of the checks provided for in Article 21.
8. The decisions referred to in paragraphs 2, 3, 4, 6 and 7 shall be based on a risk assessment, taking into consideration the recommended criteria set out in Annex II, Chapters A and B.
CHAPTER III
PREVENTION OF TSE
Article 6
Monitoring system
1. Each Member State shall carry out an annual programme for monitoring BSE and scrapie in accordance with Annex III, Chapter A. That programme shall include a screening procedure using rapid tests.
Rapid tests shall be approved for that purpose in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 24(2) and listed in Annex X, Chapter C, point 4.
2. Each Member State shall inform the Commission and the other Member States, within the Standing Veterinary Committee, of the emergence of a TSE other than BSE.
3. All official investigations and laboratory examinations shall be recorded in accordance with Annex III, Chapter B.
4. Member States shall submit an annual report to the Commission covering at least the information referred to in Annex III, Chapter B, Part I. The report for each calendar year shall be submitted at the latest by 31 March of the following year. The Commission shall present a summary of the national reports covering at least the information referred to in Annex III, Chapter B, Part II, to the Standing Veterinary Committee within three months of the receipt of the said reports.
Article 7
Prohibitions concerning animal feeding
1. The feeding to ruminants of protein derived from mammals is prohibited.
2. Furthermore, the prohibition referred to in paragraph 1 shall be extended to animals and products of animal origin in accordance with point 1 of Annex IV.
3. Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall apply without prejudice to the provisions set out in point 2 of Annex IV.
4. Member States, or regions thereof, in category 5 shall not be permitted to export or store feed intended for farmed animals which contains protein derived from mammals or feed intended for mammals, except for dogs and cats, which contains processed protein derived from mammals.
Third countries, or regions thereof, in category 5 shall not be permitted to export to the Community feed intended for livestock which contains protein derived from mammals or feed intended for mammals, except for dogs and cats, which contains processed protein derived from mammals.
5. Detailed rules for the implementation of this Article, in particular rules on the prevention of cross-contamination and on the methods of sampling and analysis required to check compliance with this Article, shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 24(2).
Article 8
Specified risk material
1. The specified risk material shall be removed and destroyed in accordance with points 2, 3, 4 and 8 of Annex V.
That specified risk material or the material processed therefrom may be placed on the market or, if need be, exported only for final destruction in accordance with points 3 and 4 or as appropriate 7(c) or 8 of Annex V. It may not be imported into the Community. Transit of specified risk material through Community territory must take place in accordance with the requirements of Article 3 of Directive 91/496/EEC.
2. Paragraph 1 shall not apply to tissues from animals which have undergone an alternative test approved for that distinct purpose in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 24(2) and listed in Annex X, Chapter C, point 5, and applied under the conditions listed in point 5 of Annex V - and where the results of the test were negative.
The Member States which authorise that alternative test must inform the other Member States and the Commission.

In Member States, or regions thereof, which are placed in categories 2, 3, 4 and 5 referred to in Annex II, Chapter C, the laceration, after stunning, of central nervous tissue by means of an elongated rod-shaped instrument introduced into the cranial cavity shall not be used on bovine, ovine or caprine animals whose meat is destined for human or animal consumption.
4. The data relating to age set out in Annex V shall be adjusted regularly. Such adjustments shall be based on the latest proven scientific findings concerning the statistical probability of the occurrence of a TSE in the relevant age groups of the Community's bovine, ovine and caprine population.
5. By way of derogation from paragraphs 1 to 4, a decision may be adopted, in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 24(2), with regard to the date of effective enforcement of Article 7(1) or, as appropriate, in the third countries, the date of banning the use of mammalian protein in feed for ruminants in each country or region placed in category 3 or 4, in order to limit the application of this Article to animals born before that date in those countries or regions.
Similarly, by way of derogation from paragraphs 1 to 4, after consultation of the appropriate scientific committee and on the basis of an assessment of the incident, propagation and human exposure risk, a decision may be adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 24(2) to allow the use for food, feed and fertilisers of vertebral column and dorsal root ganglia from bovine animals in or coming from each country or region thereof placed in category 5.
6. Rules for the implementation of this Article shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 24(2).

CHAPTER IV
CONTROL AND ERADICATION OF TSEs
Article 11
Notification
Without prejudice to Directive 82/894/EEC(12), the Member States shall ensure that any animal suspected of being infected by a TSE is notified immediately to the competent authorities.
Member States shall regularly inform each other and the Commission of the cases of TSE notified.
The competent authority shall without delay take the measures laid down in Article 12 of this Regulation, together with any other necessary measures.
Article 12
Measures with respect to suspect animals
1. Any animal suspected of being infected by a TSE shall be placed under an official movement restriction until the results of a clinical and epidemiological examination carried out by the competent authority are known, or killed for laboratory examination under official control.
If BSE is suspected in a bovine animal at a holding in a Member State, all other bovine animals from that holding shall be placed under an official movement restriction until the results of the examination are available.
If BSE is suspected in an ovine or caprine animal at a holding in a Member State on the basis of objective evidence such as the results of tests capable of differentiating in a practical way between the various TSEs, all other ovine and caprine animals from that holding shall be placed under an official movement restriction until the results of the examination are available.
If there is evidence that the holding where the animal was present when BSE was suspected is not likely to be the holding where the animal could have been exposed to BSE, the competent authority may decide that only the animal suspected of being infected shall be placed under an official movement restriction. If considered necessary, the competent authority may also decide that other holdings or only the holding of exposure shall be placed under official control depending on the epidemiological information available.
Under the procedure referred to in Article 24(2) and by way of derogation from the requirements of the second, third and fourth subparagraphs of this paragraph, a Member State may be exempted from the application of official restrictions on the movement of animals if it applies measures offering equivalent safeguards.
2. Where the competent authority decides that the possibility of infection with a TSE cannot be ruled out, the animal shall be killed, if it is still alive; its brain and all other tissues as the competent authority may determine shall be removed and sent to an officially approved laboratory, the national reference laboratory provided for in Article 19(1) or the Community reference laboratory provided for in Article 19(2), for examination in accordance with the testing methods laid down in Article 20.
3. All parts of the body of the suspect animal including the hide shall be retained under official control until a negative diagnosis has been made or shall be destroyed in accordance with Annex V, point 3 or 4.
4. Rules for the implementation of this Article shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 24(2).
Article 13
Measures following confirmation of the presence of a TSE
1. When the presence of a TSE has been officially confirmed, the following measures shall be applied as soon as possible:
(a) all parts of the body of the animal shall be completely destroyed in accordance with Annex V apart from material retained for records in accordance with Annex III, Chapter B, III, 2;
(b) an inquiry shall be carried out to identify all animals at risk in accordance with Annex VII, point 1;
(c) all animals and products of animal origin referred to in Annex VII, point 2, that have been identified as being at risk by the inquiry referred to in (b), shall be killed and completely destroyed in accordance with Annex V, points 3 and 4.
By way of derogation from this paragraph, Member States may apply other measures offering an equivalent level of protection, if those measures have been approved in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 24(2).
2. Pending the implementation of the measures referred to in paragraph 1(b) and (c), the holding on which the animal was present when the presence of a TSE was confirmed shall be placed under official control and all movement of animals susceptible to TSEs and products of animal origin derived from them from or to the holding shall be subject to authorisation by the competent authority, with a view to ensuring immediate tracing and identification of the animals and products of animal origin concerned.
If there is evidence that the holding where the affected animal was present when the TSE was confirmed is not likely to be the holding where the animal was exposed to the TSE, the competent authority may decide that both holdings or only the holding of exposure shall be placed under official control.
3. Member States which have implemented a substitute scheme offering equivalent safeguards provided for in the fifth subparagraph of Article 12(1) may, by way of derogation from the requirements of paragraph 1(b) and (c), be exempted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 24(2) from the requirement to apply official restrictions on the movement of animals and from the requirement to kill and destroy animals.
4. Owners shall be compensated without delay for the loss of the animals that have been killed or products of animal origin destroyed in accordance with Article 12(2) and paragraph 1(a) and (c) of this Article.
5. Without prejudice to Directive 82/894/EEC, the confirmed presence of any TSE other than BSE shall be notified to the Commission on an annual basis.
6. Rules for the implementation of this Article shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 24(2).
Article 14
Contingency plan
1. Member States shall draw up - in accordance with the general criteria of Community rules on the control of animal diseases - guidelines specifying the national measures to be implemented and indicating competences and responsibilities where cases of TSE are confirmed.
2. Where necessary to enable Community legislation to be applied uniformly, the guidelines may be harmonised in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 24(2).

Commission Regulation (EC) No 1282/2001
of 28 June 2001
laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 as regards the gathering of information to identify wine products and to monitor the wine market and amending Regulation (EC) No 1623/2000
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in wine(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2826/2000(2), and in particular Articles 23, 33 and 73 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 18 of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 states that producers of grapes intended for winemaking and producers of must and wine are required to make harvest declarations in respect of the most recent harvest and that producers of wine and must and commercial operators other than retailers must declare their stocks each year.
(2) That Article also stipulates that the Member States can also require grape merchants to declare the quantities of grapes marketed.
(3) In order to facilitate market management operations, a time limit should be laid down for making declarations. Since harvesting takes place at different times in different Member States, the deadlines for declarations by producers should be staggered. Provision should also be made to require operators selling wine products before the dates specified for declarations to make declarations.
(4) However, producers who can provide all the necessary information required in a single declaration of wine production need not make two declarations. Very small producers can be exempted from making declarations as their total production accounts for a very small percentage of Community production.
(5) In order to facilitate the application of this Regulation, the particulars which must be given in the declarations should be laid down here in tabular form while the Member States should be allowed to decide on the form in which operators are to provide them. The time limits by which the Member States are to centralise and forward the data they have collected to the Commission and the manner in which the data are to be forwarded should also be specified.
(6) The category of "other wines" should be defined in keeping with the classification of vine varieties that may be cultivated in the Community, as established by the Member States in accordance with Article 19 of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999.
(7) Information relating to areas could be inaccurate where the declarants have not had suitable means of verification at their disposal. Provision should therefore be made in such cases for penalties varying according to the seriousness of the inaccuracies in declarations presented.
(8) The penalty arrangements must provide for a sufficient degree of proportionality with regard to declarations submitted by wine-growers that are found to contain omissions or errors. The penalties should therefore vary with the correction made to the declarations.
(9) Harvest and stock declarations submitted by the various parties concerned are currently the only means of properly knowing the quantities of wine produced and wine stocks. Appropriate steps therefore need to be taken to ensure that declarations are presented by the parties concerned and are complete and accurate by providing for penalties where declarations are not forthcoming or are false or incomplete when presented. To facilitate the processing of data relating to declarations, each declaration presented in a competent administrative unit should be considered separately from any others that the same producer may have presented in other administrative units in the Member State.
(10) Council Regulation (EEC) No 2392/86(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1631/98(4), provides for the establishment of a Community vineyard register. The Member States with a complete register should be allowed to use certain data from that register if declarations do not provide them.
(11) Certain information must be available on the wine market to ensure that it can be monitored. In addition to the data provided in the summaries of the various declarations, information on wine supplies, utilisation and prices is essential. The Member States should therefore be required to gather this information and send it to the Commission on certain fixed dates.
(12) In this connection it should be recalled that, to ensure effective monitoring of the market and to allow reliable budget forecasts to be made in good time, the dates laid down for sending information must be complied with.
(13) With a view to ensuring the necessary consistency between the penalties provided for in this Regulation and those laid down to the same effect in Commission Regulation (EC) No 1623/2000(5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 545/2001(6), that Regulation should be amended and the penalties adapted accordingly.
(14) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Wine,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
The detailed rules for the application of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 as regards the gathering of information to identify wine products and to monitor the wine market shall be as laid down in this Regulation.
Article 2
1. Natural or legal persons or groups of such persons who harvest grapes, hereinafter referred to as "harvesters", shall submit each year to the competent authorities in the Member States a harvest declaration for the administrative unit specified, containing at least the information specified in Table A and, where appropriate, Table B of the Annex hereto.
Member States may authorise the presentation of one declaration per holding.
2. The following shall not be required to submit a harvest declaration:
(a) harvesters whose entire grape production is intended for consumption unprocessed or for drying or for processing directly into grape juice;
(b) harvesters whose holdings comprise less than 10 ares of area under vines, no part of whose harvest has been or will be marketed in any form whatsoever;
(c) harvesters whose holdings comprise less than 10 ares of area under vines and who deliver their entire harvested production to the cooperative winery or group to which they belong or with which they are associated. In such case harvesters must provide the cooperative winery or group with a declaration specifying:
(i) the name, first name and address of the wine-grower;
(ii) the quantity of grapes delivered;
(iii) the size and location of the areas under vines concerned.
The cooperative winery or group shall check the accuracy of the data contained in this declaration against the information at its disposal.
3. Notwithstanding the first subparagraph of paragraph 1 and without prejudice to the obligations arising from Article 4, Member States may exempt from the obligation to submit harvest declarations:
(a) harvesters who themselves process the whole of their harvest of grapes into wine or cause it to be processed on their behalf;
(b) harvesters associated with or belonging to a wine cooperative or group who deliver the whole of their harvest to that wine cooperative or group as grapes and/or must, including the harvesters referred to in Article 4(4).
Article 3
Article 4
1. Natural or legal persons or groups of such persons, including winemaking cooperatives, who from the current year's harvest have produced wine and/or hold, at the dates specified in Article 11(1), products other than wine shall submit a production declaration each year containing at least the information specified in Table C of the Annex hereto to the competent authorities designated by the Member States.
2. Member States may lay down that natural or legal persons or groups of such persons, including winemaking cooperatives who, before the dates specified in Article 11(1), have treated and/or marketed products upstream of wine for the current marketing year shall submit a treatment and/or marketing declaration containing at least the information specified in Table C to the competent authorities.
3. The harvesters referred to in Article 2(2) and producers who obtain, by vinification on their premises of products bought in, less than 10 hectolitres of wine which has not been or will not be marketed in any form whatsoever shall not be required to submit a production declaration or, where applicable, a treatment or marketing declaration.
4. Exemption from the obligation to submit a production declaration shall also be granted to harvesters belonging to or associated with a cooperative winery that is required to submit a declaration, who deliver their production of grapes to that winery but reserve the right to obtain by vinification a quantity of wine of less than 10 hectolitres for their family consumption.
5. In the case of natural or legal persons or groups of such persons who market products upstream of wine, the Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that producers required to submit declarations are able to obtain the various data that they must give in the declarations.
Article 5
Notwithstanding Article 4, Member States which have, in accordance with Regulation (EEC) No 2392/86, established an annually updated vineyard register or similar administrative control instrument may release the natural or legal persons, groups of such persons or harvesters referred to in that Article from the obligation to declare the area.
In such cases the competent authorities of the Member States shall themselves complete the declarations referred to in that Article by indicating the area on the basis of the data in the register.
Article 6
1. Each year natural or legal persons or groups of such persons other than private consumers and retailers shall declare the stocks of grape must, concentrated grape must, rectified concentrated grape must and wine held by them at 31 July to the competent authorities of the Member States. As regards Community wine products, such declarations shall not include those obtained from grapes harvested in the same calendar year.
However, Member States where the annual wine production does not exceed 25000 hectolitres may exempt traders other than retailers who hold small stocks from the obligation to make the declarations provided for in the first subparagraph if the competent authorities are in a position to give the Commission a statistical assessment of those stocks held in the Member State.
2. "Retailer" within the meaning of paragraph 1 means any natural or legal person or group of such persons whose business activity includes the sale of wine in small quantities directly to the consumer, with the exception of those who use cellars equipped for storing and handling wine in large quantities.
The quantities referred to in the first subparagraph shall be determined by each Member State having regard in particular to the special features of trade and distribution.
3. The declaration provided for in paragraph 1 shall contain at least the information specified in Table D in the Annex hereto.
Article 7
1. The Member States shall draw up the model forms for the various declarations and shall ensure that these forms contain at least the items specified in Tables A, B, C and D of the Annex.
The forms referred to above need not include an explicit reference to the area if the Member State is able to determine this with certainty from the other information contained in the declaration, such as the area in production and the total harvest of the holding, or in the vineyard register.
The information contained in the declarations referred to in the first subparagraph shall be centralised at national level.
Member States shall adopt any control measures necessary to ensure the accuracy of the declarations.
They shall notify the Commission of these measures and shall send in the model forms drawn up pursuant to the first subparagraph.
2. Member States whose areas under vines do not exceed 100 ha and which have at their disposal:
- some of the information that must appear on the declarations referred to in Chapters I and II from other administrative acts may leave the declarations blank in this regard;
- all of the information that must appear on the declarations referred to in Chapters I and II from other administrative acts may release operators from the obligation to submit these declarations.
The Member States in which Chapters I and II of Title II of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 do not apply pursuant to Article 21 of that Regulation and which have at their disposal:
- some of the information that must appear on the declarations referred to in Chapter III from other administrative acts may leave the declarations blank in this regard,
- all of the information that must appear on the declarations referred to in Chapter III from other administrative acts may release the operators from the requirement to submit these declarations.
Article 8
For the purposes of making out the declarations referred to in Articles 2 and 4, "other wines" means wines obtained from grapes of varieties listed in the classification of vine varieties drawn up by the Member States in accordance with Article 19 of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 for the same administrative unit as both wine-grape varieties and, as the case may be, table-grape varieties, varieties for the production of dried grapes or varieties for the production of wine spirits.
However, for the purposes of the declaration referred to in Article 4, "other wines" within the meaning of the first paragraph only means wines intended for the production of wine spirits with a registered designation of origin or wine for compulsory distillation as referred to in Article 28 of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999.
Article 9
The quantities of products to be entered in the declarations provided for in Articles 2, 4 and 6 shall be expressed in hectolitres of wine. The quantities of concentrated grape must and rectified concentrated grape must entered in the declarations referred to in Article 4 shall be expressed in hectolitres of those products.
However, Member States may lay down that the quantities in the declarations provided for in Article 2 are to be expressed in quintals rather than hectolitres.
To convert quantities of products other than wine into hectolitres of wine, the Member States may fix coefficients that may vary with different objective criteria having a bearing on the conversion. Member States shall communicate the coefficients to the Commission along with the summary provided for in Article 14.
The quantity of wine to be entered in the production declarations provided for in Article 4 shall be the total quantity obtained on completion of the principal alcoholic fermentation, including the wine lees.
Article 10
This Regulation shall not affect any provisions of Member States on harvest, production, treatment and/or marketing or stock declarations which provide for the supply of fuller information, in particular by covering a wider range of persons than those provided for in Articles 2, 4 and 6.
Article 11
1. The declarations referred to in Articles 2 and 4 shall be submitted not later than 10 December. However, Member States may set an earlier date or dates. They may also set a date at which the quantities held are taken into account in making declarations.
2. The declarations referred to in Article 6 shall be made not later than 10 September in respect of quantities held at 31 July. However, Member States may set an earlier date or dates.
Article 12
Persons required to submit harvest, production, marketing and/or treatment or stock declarations who do not submit such declarations by the dates specified in Article 11 shall not, except in cases of force majeure, qualify for the measures provided for in Articles 24, 29, 30, 34 and 35 of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 for the wine year in question or the following wine year.
However, exceeding the time limits specified in the first paragraph by not more than five working days shall entail a 15 % reduction only in the amounts payable for the wine year in question and a 30 % reduction if those time limits are exceeded by not more than 10 working days.
Article 13
1. Persons required to submit harvest, production, marketing and/or treatment or stock declarations who submit declarations found to be incomplete or inaccurate by the competent authorities of the Member States may qualify for the measures referred to in Articles 24, 29, 30, 34 and 35 of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 only if the missing or inaccurate details are not essential to the proper application of those measures.
2. Except in cases of force majeure, where the declarations referred to in this Regulation are found to be incomplete or inaccurate by the competent authorities of the Member States and where the missing or inaccurate information is essential to the proper application of the measures in question, the Member State shall apply the following penalties, irrespective of any national penalties applied:
(a) in the case of the measures referred to in Articles 24, 34 and 35 of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999, the aid shall be reduced:
- by the same percentage as the percentage adjustment made to the quantity declared, where that adjustment is 5 % or less,
- by twice the percentage of the adjustment made to the quantity declared, where that adjustment is more than 5 % but not more than 20 %.
Neither this aid nor that for the following wine year shall be granted where the adjustment made to the quantity declared is more than 20 %.
Where the error detected in the declaration arises from information supplied by other operators and/or associates whose names are entered in the required documents and that information cannot be checked a priori by the declarant, the aid shall be reduced only by the percentage of the adjustment made;
(b) in the case of the measures referred to in Articles 29 and 30 of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999, where the wine delivered for distillation has not yet been paid for, the price payable by the distiller to the declaring producer shall be reduced as follows:
- by the same percentage as the adjustment made to the declared volume, in percentage terms, where that adjustment is 5 % or less,
Neither these prices nor those for the following wine year shall be paid where the adjustment made to the quantity is more than 20 %.
Where the error detected in the declaration arises from information supplied by other operators and/or associates whose names are entered in the required documents and that information cannot be checked a priori by the declarant, the aid shall be reduced by only the percentage of the adjustment made.
The competent authorities shall adjust the aid to be paid to the distiller in proportion to the price paid to the producer.

Commission Regulation (EC) No 1322/2001
of 29 June 2001
amending Annexes I and III to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 laying down a Community procedure for the establishment of maximum residue limits of veterinary medicinal products in foodstuffs of animal origin
(Text with EEA relevance)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 of 26 June 1990 laying down a Community procedure for the establishment of maximum residue limits of veterinary medicinal products in foodstuffs of animal origin(1), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 807/2001(2), and in particular Articles 6, 7 and 8 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) In accordance with Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90, maximum residue limits must be established progressively for all pharmacologically active substances which are used within the Community in veterinary medicinal products intended for administration to food-producing animals.
(2) Maximum residue limits should be established only after the examination within the Committee for Veterinary Medicinal Products of all the relevant information concerning the safety of residues of the substance concerned for the consumer of foodstuffs of animal origin and the impact of residues on the industrial processing of foodstuffs.
(3) In establishing maximum residue limits for residues of veterinary medicinal products in foodstuffs of animal origin, it is necessary to specify the animal species in which residues may be present, the levels which may be present in each of the relevant meat tissues obtained from the treated animal (target tissue) and the nature of the residue which is relevant for the monitoring of residues (marker residue).
(4) For the control of residues, as provided for in appropriate Community legislation, maximum residue limits should usually be established for the target tissues of liver or kidney. However, the liver and kidney are frequently removed from carcases moving in international trade, and maximum residue limits should therefore also always be established for muscle or fat tissues.
(5) In the case of veterinary medicinal products intended for use in laying birds, lactating animals or honey bees, maximum residue limits must also be established for eggs, milk or honey.
(6) Florfenicol should be inserted into Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90.
(7) In order to allow for the completion of scientific studies, the duration of the validity of the provisional maximum residue limits previously defined in Annex III to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 should be extended for cefalonium, morantel and metamizole.
(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Veterinary Medicinal Products,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
Annexes I and III to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 are hereby amended as set out in the Annex hereto.
Article 2
This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
Commission Regulation (EC) No 1637/2001
of 23 July 2001
amending Council Regulation (EEC) No 3880/91 on the submission of nominal catch statistics by Member States fishing in the North-East Atlantic
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 3880/91 of 17 December 1991 on the submission of nominal catch statistics by Member States fishing in the North-East Atlantic(1), and in particular Article 2(3) and Article 4 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) The Ninth Meeting of the Conference of Parties of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) in 1994 requested the monitoring of catch and trade data on elasmobranch fish species (sharks, skates and rays) be undertaken by the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO) and by regional fishery agencies.
(2) At its 87th Statutory Meeting in 1999 the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) resolved to adopt the species groupings for elasmobranch fishes as described in the report of the Study Group on Elasmobranch Species and to request FAO to include these species on its Statlant 27A questionnaire on catch statistics for the North-East Atlantic.
(3) The ICES has extended its list of species for which catches in the North-East Atlantic are recorded in its database and thus Member States should be encouraged to submit available catch statistics for these additional species.
(4) Article 4(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 3880/91 provides that Member States, with the prior approval of Eurostat, may submit data in a different form or on a different medium from that laid down in Annex IV to the Regulation.
(5) Several Member States have requested submission of data in a different form or through a different medium from that specified in Annex IV to Regulation (EEC) No 3880/91 (the equivalent of the abovementioned Statlant questionnaires).
(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee for Agricultural Statistics set up by Council Decision 72/279/EEC(2).
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 3880/91 shall be replaced by Annex I to this Regulation.
Article 2
Member States may submit data following that in the format detailed in Annex II to this Regulation.

This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
Commission Regulation (EC) No 1660/2001
of 16 August 2001
amending Regulation (EC) No 1623/2000 laying down detailed rules for implementing Council Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 on the common organisation of the market in wine with regard to market mechanisms
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in wine(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2826/2000(2), and in particular Articles 33 and 36 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 58 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1623/2000 of 25 July 2000 laying down detailed rules for implementing Council Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 on the common organisation of the market in wine with regard to market mechanisms(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1282/2001(4), lays down rules on the remaining quantities to be delivered by producers under their obligations. In the light of experience gained, the time limit should be put back.
(2) Article 63 of Regulation (EC) No 1623/2000 provides for the introduction of an aid scheme for the distillation of potable alcohol from wine. That scheme was first introduced for the 2000/01 wine year. Changes are required in line with experience gained in the first year of application. In particular, distillation should be opened later in the year and the percentage of production that wine producers can deliver for distillation should be smaller. In addition, a time limit must be set for distillation.
(3) Articles 86 to 102 of Regulation (EC) No 1623/2000 lay down detailed rules for the disposal of alcohol held by the intervention agencies. Certain material errors should be corrected and in particular the amount to be paid for samples should be adjusted and the tolerance for bio-ethanol involving products requiring rectification should be the same as that for new industrial uses.
(4) The Management Committee for Wine has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its Chairman,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
Regulation (EC) No 1623/2000 is hereby amended as follows:

2. Article 63 is amended as follows:
(a) Paragraphs 1 and 2 are replaced by the following: "1. Distillation of table wine and wine suitable for yielding table wine in accordance with Article 29 of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 shall be opened from 16 October each wine year.
2. The quantity of table wine and wine suitable for yielding table wine that each producer may have distilled shall not exceed 30 % of his highest production of such wine declared in the last three wine years, including the current year if production has already been declared. Where the above percentage is applied, the quantity of table wine produced shall be that given as wine in the column headed 'Table wines' of the declaration of quantities produced as referred to in Article 18(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999."
(b) The following paragraph is added: "10. Wine delivered to a distillery must be distilled by 30 September of the following wine year at the latest."
3. The first paragraph of Article 86 is replaced by the following: "The Commission, acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 75 of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999, shall issue several invitations to tender every quarter, each relating to at least 50000 hectolitres of wine alcohol and, taken together, relating to not more than 600000 hectolitres of alcohol at 100 % vol each quarter, for export to certain third countries for end use in the motor-fuel sector only."
4. Article 91(12) is replaced by the following: "12. The intervention agency concerned shall release the export security for each quantity of alcohol for which it receives proof of export within the time limit allowed. Notwithstanding Article 23 of Regulation (EEC) No 2220/85 and except in cases of force majeure, where the time limit for export is exceeded the following percentages of the export security of EUR 3 per hectolitre of alcohol at 100 % vol shall be forfeit:
(a) 15 % in all cases;
(b) 0,33 % of the amount remaining after 15 % has been deducted for each day by which the time limit for export has been exceeded."
5. The second and third subparagraphs of Article 95(2) are replaced by the following: "This prohibition shall not relate to alcohol in vats not covered by the notices of invitation to tender or public sale concerned or not specified in the Commission decision referred to in Articles 83 to 93.
For logistical reasons in particular, the intervention agencies holding the vats of alcohol specified in the notification from the Member States referred to in paragraph 1 may replace the alcohol concerned with other alcohol of the same type or mix it with other alcohol delivered to the intervention agency until a removal order is issued for the alcohol concerned. The intervention agencies of the Member States shall notify the Commission that the alcohol has been replaced."
6. Article 98 is amended as follows:
(a) Paragraph 1 is replaced by the following: "1. From the publication of a notice of invitation to tender to the closing date for the submission of tenders in response to that invitation, interested parties may obtain samples of the alcohol put up for sale against payment of EUR 10 per litre.

However, losses may not exceed the limits specified in point (b)."
Article 2
This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
Commission Regulation (EC) No 1681/2001
of 22 August 2001
amending Regulation (EC) No 174/1999 laying down special detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EEC) No 804/68 as regards export licences and export refunds in the case of milk and milk products and Regulation (EC) No 1498/1999 laying down rules for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 804/68 as regards communications between the Member States and the Commission in the milk and milk products sector
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1670/2000(2), and in particular Article 26(3), Article 30, Article 31(14) and Article 40 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 1 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 174/1999 of 26 January 1999 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EEC) No 804/68 as regards export licences and export refunds in the case of milk and milk products(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1370/2001(4), lays down, as a general rule, that all exports of milk products for which a refund is requested are to be subject to the presentation of an export licence. For the efficient management of the domestic market in skimmed-milk powder - a product that may be subject to intervention measures - export licences for that product should be made compulsory and provision should be made for the notification of this information by the Member States to the Commission. Commission Regulation (EC) No 1498/1999 of 8 July 1999 laying down rules for the application of Council Regulation (EEC) No 804/68 as regards communications between Member States and the Commission in the milk and milk products sector(5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 732/2001(6), should therefore be amended.
(2) A drafting error in Article 9 of Regulation (EC) No 174/1999 should be corrected.
(3) The sucrose component of milk products is not taken into account when the basic amount of the refund for the milk content is fixed at zero. This provision should be extended to cases where a refund for the milk content has not been fixed.
(4) The full licences for exports without a refund to the United States under the supplementary quota arising from the Agreement on Agriculture included in the Uruguay Round GATT Agreements(7) (hereinafter referred to as the "Agreement on Agriculture") do not require a security to be lodged. In order to best ensure that this quota is actually filled and that the licences issued to this end are really used, provision should be made for the lodgement of a security.
(5) In order to simplify the securities for the provisional licences referred to in Article 20, the security for the provisional licence should be adjusted and the operation of the security for the full licence should be described in detail.
(6) The Management Committee for Milk and Milk Products has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its Chairman,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
Regulation (EC) No 174/1999 is amended as follows:
1. The following second subparagraph is added to Article 1(1): "However, the first subparagraph notwithstanding, an export licence must be presented for all exports of the products referred to in Annex I, Number II."
2. Article 9(a) is replaced by the following: "(a) 5 % for products covered by CN code 0405;"
3. The second subparagraph of Article 16(3) is replaced by the following: "However, the sucrose component shall not be taken into account where the basic amount of the refund for the milk product content referred to in the second subparagraph of paragraph 2 is zero or is not fixed."
4. In the second subparagraph of Article 20(2), "EUR 9" is replaced by "EUR 6".
5. Article 20(10) is replaced by the following: "10. Before the end of the year for which the provisional licences are issued, the interested party shall apply for the full licence, even in the case of part quantities, which shall be issued forthwith, on condition that the security referred to in paragraph 2 is increased to the total amount laid down in Article 9 for the quantities for which the licences are allocated. The following words shall be entered in section 20 of the application for the full licence and in the licence itself: 'For export to the United States of America: Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 174/1999.'
Licences issued under this Article shall be valid only for the exports referred to in paragraph 1.
The security for the full licence shall be released only on presentation of the proof referred to in Article 35(5) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000(8)."
Article 2
The first point of Article 9 of Regulation (EC) No 1498/1999 shall be replaced by the following: "1. By 6 p.m. on each working day, with the exception of quantities covered by export licence applications either under Article 18 and Article 19(5) of Regulation (EC) No 174/1999 or for supplies of food aid within the meaning of Article 10(4) of the Agreement on Agriculture concluded under the Uruguay Round:
(a) the quantities, broken down by code of the export refund nomenclature for milk products and by destination code, covered by applications submitted that day for licences:
(i) as referred to in Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 174/1999, with the exception of those referred to in Article 17 of that Regulation (IDES computer code 1);
(b) the quantities, broken down by application and by code of the export refund nomenclature for milk products and by destination code, covered by applications for provisional licences as referred to in Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 174/1999 submitted on that day, indicating the closing date for submitting tenders and the quantity of products covered by the invitation to tender or, in the case of an invitation to tender opened by the armed forces within the meaning of Article 36(1)(c) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 (1) not specifying the quantity, the approximate quantity broken down as specified above (IDES computer code 2);
(c) the quantities, broken down by code of the export refund nomenclature for milk products and by destination code, for which the provisional licences referred to in Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 174/1999 were definitively issued or cancelled that day, indicating the body issuing the invitation to tender, the date of the provisional licence and the quantity it covers.
(d) where appropriate, the revised quantity of products covered by the invitation to tender referred to in (b) above."
Article 3
This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
Council Regulation (EC) No 2136/2001
of 23 October 2001
amending Regulation (EC) No 723/97 on the implementation of Member States' action programmes on control of EAGGF Guarantee Section expenditure
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 37 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament(2),
Whereas:
(1) Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 723/97(3) provides for the Community to contribute towards costs incurred by Member States in implementing new action programmes, arising out of new Community obligations, approved by the Commission and aimed at improving the structures or effectiveness of EAGGF Guarantee Section expenditure controls. Article 4 of the said Regulation provides that the Community financial contribution is to be granted per calendar year for a period of five consecutive years starting from 1997, within the limit of the annual appropriations authorised by the budget authority in the light of the financial perspective.
(2) The Commission has transmitted to the Council a report on the results of the application of Regulation (EC) No 723/97 during the period 1997 to 2000. Given the assessment reports prepared by the Member States and the effectiveness of the programmes implemented, the Commission considers that Member States should continue to receive financial assistance for the implementation of the programmes provided for in Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 723/97.
(3) In particular, since new expensive techniques have been introduced by Council Regulation (EC) No 1593/2000 of 17 July 2000 amending Regulation (EEC) No 3508/92 establishing an integrated administration and control system for certain Community aid schemes(4), in the area of the improvement of the agricultural parcel identification system having recourse to the technique of geographical information system and of digital orthophotography, a Community contribution is justified to cover part of the expenditure incurred by Member States in the framework of new action programmes covering this domain. In this context, it is appropriate, for reasons of legal clarity, to delete the last indent of Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 723/97.
(4) The period during which Community financial contribution may be paid should therefore be extended by two years.
(5) Regulation (EC) No 723/97 should be amended accordingly,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
Regulation (EC) No 723/97 is hereby amended as follows:
2. In the first sentence of Article 4(1), the term "five consecutive years" shall be replaced by "seven consecutive years".
Commission Regulation (EC) No 2601/2001
of 28 December 2001
supplementing the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 2400/96 on the entry of certain names in the Register of protected designations of origin and protected geographical indications provided for in Council Regulation (EEC) No 2081/92 on the protection of geographical indications and designations of origin for agricultural products and foodstuffs
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2081/92 of 14 July 1992 on the protection of geographical indications and designations of origin for agricultural products and foodstuffs(1), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2796/2000(2), and in particular Article 6(3) and (4) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) In accordance with Article 5 of Regulation (EEC) No 2081/92 Spain has sent the Commission applications for the registration of the name "Manzana Reineta del Bierzo" as a designation of origin and of the name "Salchich√≥n de Vic"/"Llonganissa de Vic" as a geographical indication.
(2) In accordance with Article 6(1) of that Regulation the applications have been found to meet all the requirements laid down therein and in particular to contain all the information required in accordance with Article 4 thereof.
(3) No statements of objection within the meaning of Article 7 of Regulation (EEC) No 2081/92 have been forwarded to the Commission following publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities(3) of the names in the Annex to this Regulation.
(4) The names should therefore be entered in the Register of protected designations of origin and protected geographical indications and hence be protected throughout the Community as protected designations of origin and protected geographical indications.
(5) The Annex to this Regulation supplements the Annex to Commission Regulation (EC) No 2400/96(4), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2372/2001(5),
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
The names in the Annex to this Regulation are added to the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 2400/96 and entered as protected designations of origin (PDO) and protected geographical indications (PGI) in the Register of protected designations of origin and protected geographical indications provided for in Article 6(3) of Regulation (EEC) No 2081/92.
Article 2
This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
Commission Decision
of 4 February 2002
(Text with EEA relevance)
(2002/79/EC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 93/43/EEC of 14 June 1993 on the hygiene of foodstuffs(1) and in particular Article 10(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Peanuts originating in or consigned from China have been found to be, in many cases, contaminated with excessive levels of aflatoxin B1 and total aflatoxin.
(2) The Scientific Committee for Food has noted that aflatoxin B1, even at extremely low levels, causes cancer of the liver and in addition is genotoxic.
(3) Commission Regulation (EC) No 194/97 of 31 January 1997 setting maximum levels for certain contaminants in foodstuffs(2), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1566/1999(3), sets maximum levels for certain contaminants and in particular aflatoxins in foodstuffs. These limits have been considerably exceeded in samples of peanuts originating in or consigned from China.
(4) This constitutes a serious threat to public health within the Community and it is therefore imperative to adopt protective measures at Community level.
(5) A mission was carried out by the European Commission's Food and Veterinary Office (FVO) in China from 8 to 21 May 2001 to assess the control systems in place to prevent aflatoxin contamination in peanuts intended for export to the European Community. The mission revealed, inter alia, that the control over aflatoxins in peanuts is minimal in production or general processing. Deficiencies in laboratory performance were also observed. It is therefore appropriate to subject peanuts or products derived from peanuts originating in or consigned from China to special conditions to provide a high level of protection to public health.
(6) It is necessary that peanuts and products derived from peanuts have been produced, sorted, handled, processed, packaged and transported following good hygiene practices. It is necessary to establish the levels of aflatoxin B1 and total aflatoxin in samples taken from the consignment immediately prior to leaving China.
(7) The Chinese authorities should provide documentary evidence to accompany each consignment of peanuts originating in or consigned from China, relating to the conditions of production, sorting, handling, processing, packaging and transport, as well as the results of laboratory analysis of the consignment for levels of aflatoxin B1 and total aflatoxin.
(8) From the findings of the abovementioned mission, it can be concluded that the Chinese authorities cannot ensure currently dependable analytical results or guarantee lot integrity in respect of certification. Therefore, the reliability of any certificate issued for peanuts originating from China raises serious doubts with regard to its reliability.
(9) It is therefore necessary in order to safeguard public health that all lots of peanuts originating in or consigned from China, imported in the European Community, are subjected to sampling and analysis for their aflatoxin level by the competent authority of the importing Member State prior to release onto the market. Given that this measure has a serious impact on the control resources of the Member States, the results of this measure will be evaluated after a short period of time and the measures amended if appropriate.
(10) The Standing Committee for Foodstuffs has been consulted on 2 April 2001 and on 19 July 2001,
HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:
Article 1
1. Member States may not import products falling in any of the following categories originating in or consigned from China, which are intended for human consumption or to be used as an ingredient in foodstuffs, unless the consignment is accompanied by the results of official sampling and analysis, and by the health certificate in Annex I completed, signed and verified by a representative of the State Administration for Entry-Exit inspection and Quarantine of the People's Republic of China:
- peanuts falling within CN code 1202 10 90 or 1202 20 00,
- peanuts falling within CN code 2008 11 94 (in immediate packs of a net content exceeding 1 kg) or 2008 11 98 (in immediate packs of a net content not exceeding 1 kg),
- roasted peanuts falling within CN codes 2008 11 92 (in immediate packs of a net content exceeding 1 kg) or 2008 11 96 (in immediate packs of a net content not exceeding 1 kg).
2. Consignments may only be imported into the Community through one of the points of entry listed in Annex II.
3. Each consignment shall be identified with a code, which corresponds to the code on the health certificate and on the accompanying report containing the result of the official sampling and analysis referred to in paragraph 1.
4. The Competent Authorities in each Member State shall ensure that imported peanuts originating in or consigned from China are subject to documentary checks to ensure that the requirement for the health certificate and sampling results referred to in paragraph 1 are complied with.
5. Member States shall undertake sampling and analysis of each consignment of peanuts originating in or consigned from China for aflatoxin B1 and total aflatoxin before release onto the market from the port of entry into the Community, and shall inform the Commission of the results.
Article 2
Decision of the European Parliament
of 14 March 2002
amending Decision 94/262/ECSC, EC, Euratom on the regulations and general conditions governing the performance of the Ombudsman's duties
(2002/262/EC, ECSC, Euratom)
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community and in particular Article 195(2) thereof,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community and in particular Article 20 D(4) thereof,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community and in particular Article 107 D(4) thereof,
Having regard to the European Parliament resolution of 17 November 2000 on the modification of the European Parliament's decision of 9 March 1994 on the regulations and general conditions governing the performance of the Ombudsman's duties(1),
Having regard to the opinion of the Commission,
With the approval of the Council,
Whereas:
(1) Pursuant to Article 22, paragraph 5, of the Financial Regulation of 21 December 1977 applicable to the general budget of the European Communities(2), the Ombudsman is treated as an institution for the purposes of that Regulation.
(2) Council Regulation (EC, ECSC, Euratom) No 2673/1999 amending the Financial Regulation created a specific section for the Ombudsman in the general budget of the European Union and amended the provisions of the Financial Regulation relative thereto accordingly.
(3) It is therefore necessary to amend European Parliament Decision 94/262/ECSC, EC, Euratom of 9 March 1994 on the regulations and general conditions governing the performance of the Ombudsman's duties(3) since it provides for the budget of the Ombudsman to be placed in an annex to Section I (Parliament) of the general budget of the European Communities.
(4) Articles 12 and 16 of that decision must therefore be deleted.
HEREBY DECIDES:
Article 1
Articles 12 and 16 of decision 94/262/ECSC, EC, Euratom shall be deleted.
Article 2
Commission Decision
of 29 July 2002
establishing the European Regulators Group for Electronic Communications Networks and Services
(Text with EEA relevance)
(2002/627/EC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Whereas:
(1) A new regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services has been established in accordance with European Parliament and Council Directives 2002/21/EC of 7 March 2002 on a common regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services (Framework Directive)(1), 2002/19/EC of 7 March 2002 on access to, and interconnection of, electronic communications networks and associated facilities (Access Directive)(2), 2002/20/EC of 7 March 2002 on the authorisation of electronic communications networks and services (Authorisation Directive)(3) and 2002/22/EC of 7 March 2002 on the universal services and users' rights related to electronic communications networks and services (Universal Service Directive)(4).
(2) National regulatory authorities have been set up in all Member States to carry out the regulatory tasks specified in these Directives and as to be notified to the Commission in accordance with Article 3(6) of the Framework Directive. In accordance with the Framework Directive, Member States must guarantee the independence of national regulatory authorities by ensuring that they are legally distinct from and functionally independent of all organisations providing electronic communications networks, equipment or services. Member States that retain ownership or control of undertakings providing electronic communications networks and/or services must also ensure effective structural separation of the regulatory function from activities associated with ownership or control.
(3) Detailed responsibilities and tasks of the national regulatory authorities differ among the various Member States, but all of them have at least one national regulatory authority who is charged with application of the rules once they have been transposed into national law, in particular the rules concerning day-to-day supervision of the market.
(4) The need for the relevant rules to be consistently applied in all Member States is essential for the successful development of an internal market for electronic communications networks and services. The new regulatory framework sets out objectives to be achieved and provides a framework for action by national regulatory authorities, whilst granting them flexibility in certain areas to apply the rules in the light of national conditions.
(5) A European Regulators Group for Electronic Communications Networks and Services (hereinafter referred to as the Group) should be established to provide an interface for advising and assisting the Commission in the electronic communications field.
(6) The Group should provide an interface between national regulatory authorities and the Commission in such a way as to contribute to the development of the internal market. It should also allow cooperation between national regulatory authorities and the Commission in a transparent manner so as to ensure the consistent application in all Member States of the regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services.
(7) The Group should serve as a body for reflection, debate and advice for the Commission in the electronic communications field, including on matters related to the implementation and revision of Recommendation on Relevant Product and Service Markets and in drawing up the Decision on transnational markets.
(8) Close cooperation should be maintained between the Group and the Communications Committee established under the Framework Directive. The work of the Group should not interfere with the work of the Committee.
(9) Coordination should be ensured with the Radio Spectrum Committee established under a Decision No 676/2002/EC of the European Parliament and Council of 7 March 2002 on a regulatory framework for radio spectrum policy in the European Community (Radio Spectrum Decision)(5), the Radio Spectrum Policy Group established under the Commission Decision 2002/622/EC of 26 July 2002 establishing a Radio Spectrum Policy Group(6) and the Television Without frontiers Contact Committee, created pursuant to Directive 97/36/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council(7) on the coordination of certain provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action in Member States concerning the pursuit of television broadcasting activities,

Commission Decision
of 21 November 2002
amending Decision 94/652/EC as regards updating the inventory of tasks to be undertaken within the framework of cooperation by Member States in the scientific examination of questions relating to food
(2002/916/EC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 93/5/EEC of 25 February 1993 on assistance to the Commission and cooperation by the Member States in the scientific examination of questions relating to food(1), and in particular the fourth indent of Article 3(2) thereof,

HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:
Article 1
The Annex to Decision 94/652/EC is replaced by the text in the Annex to this Decision.
Article 2
This Decision is addressed to the Member States.
Directive 2002/14/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council
of 11 March 2002
establishing a general framework for informing and consulting employees in the European Community
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 137(2) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee(2),
Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions(3),
Acting in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 251(4), and in the light of the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee on 23 January 2002,
Whereas:
(1) Pursuant to Article 136 of the Treaty, a particular objective of the Community and the Member States is to promote social dialogue between management and labour.
(2) Point 17 of the Community Charter of Fundamental Social Rights of Workers provides, inter alia, that information, consultation and participation for workers must be developed along appropriate lines, taking account of the practices in force in different Member States.
(3) The Commission consulted management and labour at Community level on the possible direction of Community action on the information and consultation of employees in undertakings within the Community.
(4) Following this consultation, the Commission considered that Community action was advisable and again consulted management and labour on the contents of the planned proposal; management and labour have presented their opinions to the Commission.
(5) Having completed this second stage of consultation, management and labour have not informed the Commission of their wish to initiate the process potentially leading to the conclusion of an agreement.
(6) The existence of legal frameworks at national and Community level intended to ensure that employees are involved in the affairs of the undertaking employing them and in decisions which affect them has not always prevented serious decisions affecting employees from being taken and made public without adequate procedures having been implemented beforehand to inform and consult them.
(7) There is a need to strengthen dialogue and promote mutual trust within undertakings in order to improve risk anticipation, make work organisation more flexible and facilitate employee access to training within the undertaking while maintaining security, make employees aware of adaptation needs, increase employees' availability to undertake measures and activities to increase their employability, promote employee involvement in the operation and future of the undertaking and increase its competitiveness.
(8) There is a need, in particular, to promote and enhance information and consultation on the situation and likely development of employment within the undertaking and, where the employer's evaluation suggests that employment within the undertaking may be under threat, the possible anticipatory measures envisaged, in particular in terms of employee training and skill development, with a view to offsetting the negative developments or their consequences and increasing the employability and adaptability of the employees likely to be affected.
(9) Timely information and consultation is a prerequisite for the success of the restructuring and adaptation of undertakings to the new conditions created by globalisation of the economy, particularly through the development of new forms of organisation of work.
(10) The Community has drawn up and implemented an employment strategy based on the concepts of "anticipation", "prevention" and "employability", which are to be incorporated as key elements into all public policies likely to benefit employment, including the policies of individual undertakings, by strengthening the social dialogue with a view to promoting change compatible with preserving the priority objective of employment.
(11) Further development of the internal market must be properly balanced, maintaining the essential values on which our societies are based and ensuring that all citizens benefit from economic development.
(12) Entry into the third stage of economic and monetary union has extended and accelerated the competitive pressures at European level. This means that more supportive measures are needed at national level.
(13) The existing legal frameworks for employee information and consultation at Community and national level tend to adopt an excessively a posteriori approach to the process of change, neglect the economic aspects of decisions taken and do not contribute either to genuine anticipation of employment developments within the undertaking or to risk prevention.
(14) All of these political, economic, social and legal developments call for changes to the existing legal framework providing for the legal and practical instruments enabling the right to be informed and consulted to be exercised.
(15) This Directive is without prejudice to national systems regarding the exercise of this right in practice where those entitled to exercise it are required to indicate their wishes collectively.
(16) This Directive is without prejudice to those systems which provide for the direct involvement of employees, as long as they are always free to exercise the right to be informed and consulted through their representatives.
(17) Since the objectives of the proposed action, as outlined above, cannot be adequately achieved by the Member States, in that the object is to establish a framework for employee information and consultation appropriate for the new European context described above, and can therefore, in view of the scale and impact of the proposed action, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve these objectives.
(18) The purpose of this general framework is to establish minimum requirements applicable throughout the Community while not preventing Member States from laying down provisions more favourable to employees.
(19) The purpose of this general framework is also to avoid any administrative, financial or legal constraints which would hinder the creation and development of small and medium-sized undertakings. To this end, the scope of this Directive should be restricted, according to the choice made by Member States, to undertakings with at least 50 employees or establishments employing at least 20 employees.
(20) This takes into account and is without prejudice to other national measures and practices aimed at fostering social dialogue within companies not covered by this Directive and within public administrations.
(21) However, on a transitional basis, Member States in which there is no established statutory system of information and consultation of employees or employee representation should have the possibility of further restricting the scope of the Directive as regards the numbers of employees.
(22) A Community framework for informing and consulting employees should keep to a minimum the burden on undertakings or establishments while ensuring the effective exercise of the rights granted.
(23) The objective of this Directive is to be achieved through the establishment of a general framework comprising the principles, definitions and arrangements for information and consultation, which it will be for the Member States to comply with and adapt to their own national situation, ensuring, where appropriate, that management and labour have a leading role by allowing them to define freely, by agreement, the arrangements for informing and consulting employees which they consider to be best suited to their needs and wishes.
(24) Care should be taken to avoid affecting some specific rules in the field of employee information and consultation existing in some national laws, addressed to undertakings or establishments which pursue political, professional, organisational, religious, charitable, educational, scientific or artistic aims, as well as aims involving information and the expression of opinions.
(25) Undertakings and establishments should be protected against disclosure of certain particularly sensitive information.
(26) The employer should be allowed not to inform and consult where this would seriously damage the undertaking or the establishment or where he has to comply immediately with an order issued to him by a regulatory or supervisory body.
(27) Information and consultation imply both rights and obligations for management and labour at undertaking or establishment level.
(28) Administrative or judicial procedures, as well as sanctions that are effective, dissuasive and proportionate in relation to the seriousness of the offence, should be applicable in cases of infringement of the obligations based on this Directive.
(29) This Directive should not affect the provisions, where these are more specific, of Council Directive 98/59/EC of 20 July 1998 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to collective redundancies(5) and of Council Directive 2001/23/EC of 12 March 2001 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the safeguarding of employees' rights in the event of transfers of undertakings, businesses or parts of undertakings or businesses(6).
(30) Other rights of information and consultation, including those arising from Council Directive 94/45/EEC of 22 September 1994 on the establishment of a European Works Council or a procedure in Community-scale undertakings and Community-scale groups of undertakings for the purposes of informing and consulting employees(7), should not be affected by this Directive.
(31) Implementation of this Directive should not be sufficient grounds for a reduction in the general level of protection of workers in the areas to which it applies,

Directive 2002/61/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council
of 19 July 2002
amending for the nineteenth time Council Directive 76/769/EEC relating to restrictions on the marketing and use of certain dangerous substances and preparations (azocolourants)
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 95 thereof,
Having regard to the proposals from the Commission(1),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee(2),
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty(3),
Whereas:
(1) Work on the internal market should gradually improve the quality of life, health protection and consumer safety. The measures provided for in this Directive ensure a high level of health and consumer protection.
(2) Textile and leather articles containing certain azodyes have the capacity to release certain arylamines, which may pose cancer risks.
(3) Limitations already adopted or planned by certain Member States on the use of azodyed textile and leather articles concern the completion and functioning of the internal market. It is therefore necessary to approximate the laws of the Member States in this field and, consequently, to amend Annex I to Council Directive 76/769/EEC of 27 July 1976 on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States relating to restrictions on the marketing and use of certain dangerous substances and preparations(4).
(4) The Scientific Committee on Toxicity, Ecotoxicity and the Environment (CSTEE), after being consulted by the Commission, has confirmed that cancer risks posed by textile and leather goods coloured by certain azodyes, give cause for concern.
(5) In order to protect human health, the use of dangerous azodyes and the placing on the market of some articles coloured with such dyes should be prohibited.
(6) For textile articles made of recycled fibres, a maximum concentration of 70 ppm for the amines listed in point 43 in the appendix to Directive 76/769/EEC should be applied. This should be the case for a transitional period until 1 January 2005 if the amines are released by the residues deriving from the previous dyeing of the same fibres. This will allow for the recycling of textiles, which has overall benefits for the environment.
(7) Harmonised testing methods are necessary for the application of this Directive. The Commission, in accordance with Article 2a of Directive 76/769/EEC, should establish such methods. The testing methods should preferably be developed at European level, if appropriate by the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN).
(8) In the light of new scientific knowledge, testing methods should be reviewed, including testing methods for analysing 4-amino azobenzene.
(9) In the light of new scientific knowledge, the provisions on certain azocolourants should be reviewed, in particular with regard to the need to include other materials not covered by this Directive, as well as other aromatic amines. Special attention should be paid to possible risks to children.
(10) This Directive applies without prejudice to Community legislation laying down minimum requirements for the protection of workers contained in Council Directive 89/391/EEC(5) and in individual directives based thereon, in particular Council Directive 90/394/EEC(6) and Directive 98/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council(7),
HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:
Article 1
Annex I to Directive 76/769/EEC is hereby amended as set out in the Annex to this Directive.
Article 2
Testing methods for the application of point 43 of Annex I to Directive 76/769/EEC shall be adopted by the Commission in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 2a of that Directive.
They shall apply these provisions from 11 September 2003.
2. When Member States adopt these measures, they shall contain a reference to this Directive or shall be accompanied by such reference on the occasion of their official publication. The methods of making such reference shall be laid down by Member States.

Directive 2002/85/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council
of 5 November 2002
amending Council Directive 92/6/EEC on the installation and use of speed limitation devices for certain categories of motor vehicles in the Community
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 71 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee(2),
Following consultation of the Committee of the Regions,
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty(3),
Whereas:
(1) Transport safety and environmental issues connected with transport are vital in ensuring sustainable mobility.
(2) The use of speed limitation devices for heaviest-motor vehicle categories has had a positive effect on the improvement of road safety. It has also contributed to environmental protection.
(3) Council Directive 92/6/EEC(4) provides that, depending on technical possibilities and experiences in Member States, the requirements on installation and use of speed limitation devices could subsequently be extended to light goods vehicles.
(4) The extension of the scope of Directive 92/6/EEC to vehicles of more than 3,5 tonnes designed for transporting goods or passengers was one of the measures advocated by the Council in its resolution of 26 June 2000 on the improvement of road safety(5), in accordance with the Commission communication of 20 March 2000 on priorities in EU road safety.
(5) The scope of Directive 92/6/EEC should be extended to motor vehicles of category M2, to vehicles of category M3 having a maximum mass of more than 5 tonnes but not exceeding 10 tonnes and to vehicles of category N2.
(6) Since the objectives of the proposed action, namely the introduction of modifications to the Community-wide arrangements for the installation and use of speed limitation devices on certain heavy vehicle categories, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale or effects of the action, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve those objectives.
(7) Directive 92/6/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly,
HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:
Article 1
Directive 92/6/EEC is hereby amended as follows:
1. Articles 1 to 5 shall be replaced by the following:
"Article 1
For the purposes of this Directive, 'motor vehicle' means any power-driven vehicle falling within category M2, M3, N2 or N3, intended for use on the road and having at least four wheels and a maximum design speed exceeding 25 km/h.
Categories M2, M3, N2 and N3 shall be understood to be those defined in Annex II to Directive 70/156/EEC(6).
Article 2
Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that motor vehicles of categories M2 and M3 referred to in Article 1 may be used on the road only if equipped with a speed limitation device set in such a way that their speed cannot exceed 100 kilometres per hour.
Category M3 vehicles registered before 1 January 2005 with a maximum mass exceeding 10 tonnes may continue to be equipped with devices on which the maximum speed is set at 100 kilometres per hour.
Article 3
1. Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that motor vehicles of categories N2 and N3 may be used on the road only if equipped with a speed limitation device set in such a way that their speed cannot exceed 90 kilometres per hour.
2. Member States shall be authorised to require that the speed limitation device in vehicles registered in their territory and used exclusively for the transport of dangerous goods is set in such a way that those vehicles cannot exceed a maximum speed of less than 90 kilometres per hour.
Article 4
1. For motor vehicles of category M3 having a maximum mass of more than 10 tonnes and motor vehicles of category N3, Articles 2 and 3 shall be applied:
(a) to vehicles registered as from 1 January 1994, from 1 January 1994;
(b) to vehicles registered between 1 January 1988 and 1 January 1994:
(i) from 1 January 1995, in the case of vehicles used for both national and international transport;
(ii) from 1 January 1996, in the case of vehicles used exclusively for national transport.
2. For motor vehicles of category M2, vehicles of category M3 having a maximum mass of more than 5 tonnes but not exceeding 10 tonnes and vehicles of category N2, Articles 2 and 3 shall apply at the latest:
(a) to vehicles registered as from 1 January 2005;
(b) to vehicles complying with the limit values set out in Directive 88/77/EEC(7) registered between 1 October 2001 and 1 January 2005:
(i) from 1 January 2006 in the case of vehicles used for both national and international transport operations;
(ii) from 1 January 2007 in the case of vehicles used solely for national transport operations.
3. For a period of no more than three years from 1 January 2005, any Member State may exempt from the provisions of Articles 2 and 3 category M2 vehicles and category N2 vehicles with a maximum mass of more than 3,5 tonnes but not exceeding 7,5 tonnes, registered in the national register and not travelling on the territory of another Member State.
Article 5
1. The speed limitation devices referred to in Articles 2 and 3 must satisfy the technical requirements laid down in the Annex to Directive 92/24/EEC(8). However, all vehicles covered by this Directive and registered before 1 January 2005 may continue to be equipped with speed limitation devices which satisfy the technical requirements laid down by the competent national authorities.
2. Speed limitation devices shall be installed by workshops or bodies approved by the Member States."
2. The following Article shall be inserted:
"Article 6a
As part of the road safety action programme for the period 2002 to 2010, the Commission shall assess the road safety and road traffic implications of adjusting the speed limitation devices used by category M2 vehicles and by category N2 vehicles with a maximum mass of 7,5 tonnes or less to the speeds laid down by this Directive.
If necessary, the Commission shall submit appropriate proposals."
Article 2
Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by 1 January 2005 at the latest. They shall forthwith inform the Commission thereof.
When Member States adopt these measures, they shall contain a reference to this Directive or shall be accompanied by such reference on the occasion of their official publication. The methods of making such reference shall be laid down by Member States.
Article 3
This Directive shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
Article 4
This Directive is addressed to the Member States.
Directive 2002/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council
of 16 December 2002
on the supplementary supervision of credit institutions, insurance undertakings and investment firms in a financial conglomerate and amending Council Directives 73/239/EEC, 79/267/EEC, 92/49/EEC, 92/96/EEC, 93/6/EEC and 93/22/EEC, and Directives 98/78/EC and 2000/12/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 47(2) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee(2),
After consulting the Committee of the Regions,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Central Bank(3),
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty(4),
Whereas:
(1) The current Community legislation provides for a comprehensive set of rules on the prudential supervision of credit institutions, insurance undertakings and investment firms on a stand alone basis and credit institutions, insurance undertakings and investment firms which are part of respectively a banking/investment firm group or an insurance group, i.e. groups with homogeneous financial activities.
(2) New developments in financial markets have led to the creation of financial groups which provide services and products in different sectors of the financial markets, called financial conglomerates. Until now, there has been no form of prudential supervision on a group-wide basis of credit institutions, insurance undertakings and investment firms which are part of such a conglomerate, in particular as regards the solvency position and risk concentration at the level of the conglomerate, the intra-group transactions, the internal risk management processes at conglomerate level, and the fit and proper character of the management. Some of these conglomerates are among the biggest financial groups which are active in the financial markets and provide services on a global basis. If such conglomerates, and in particular credit institutions, insurance undertakings and investment firms which are part of such a conglomerate, were to face financial difficulties, these could seriously destabilise the financial system and affect individual depositors, insurance policy holders and investors.
(3) The Commission Action Plan for Financial Services identifies a series of actions which are needed to complete the Single Market in Financial Services, and announces the development of supplementary prudential legislation for financial conglomerates which will address loopholes in the present sectoral legislation and additional prudential risks to ensure sound supervisory arrangements with regard to financial groups with cross-sectoral financial activities. Such an ambitious objective can only be attained in stages. The establishment of the supplementary supervision of credit institutions, insurance undertakings and investment firms in a financial conglomerate is one such stage.
(4) Other international forums have also identified the need for the development of appropriate supervisory concepts with regard to financial conglomerates.
(5) In order to be effective, the supplementary supervision of credit institutions, insurance undertakings and investment firms in a financial conglomerate should be applied to all such conglomerates, the cross-sectoral financial activities of which are significant, which is the case when certain thresholds are reached, no matter how they are structured. Supplementary supervision should cover all financial activities identified by the sectoral financial legislation and all entities principally engaged in such activities should be included in the scope of the supplementary supervision, including asset management companies.
(6) Decisions not to include a particular entity in the scope of supplementary supervision should be taken, bearing in mind inter alia whether or not such entity is included in the group-wide supervision under sectoral rules.
(7) The competent authorities should be able to assess at a group-wide level the financial situation of credit institutions, insurance undertakings and investment firms which are part of a financial conglomerate, in particular as regards solvency (including the elimination of multiple gearing of own funds instruments), risk concentration and intra-group transactions.
(8) Financial conglomerates are often managed on a business-line basis which does not fully coincide with the conglomerate's legal structures. In order to take account of this trend, the requirements for management should be further extended, in particular as regards the management of the mixed financial holding company.
(9) All financial conglomerates subject to supplementary supervision should have a coordinator appointed from among the competent authorities involved.
(10) The tasks of the coordinator should not affect the tasks and responsibilities of the competent authorities as provided for by the sectoral rules.
(11) The competent authorities involved, and especially the coordinator, should have the means of obtaining from the entities within a financial conglomerate, or from other competent authorities, the information necessary for the performance of their supplementary supervision.
(12) There is a pressing need for increased collaboration between authorities responsible for the supervision of credit institutions, insurance undertakings and investment firms, including the development of ad hoc cooperation arrangements between the authorities involved in the supervision of entities belonging to the same financial conglomerate.
(13) Credit institutions, insurance undertakings and investment firms which have their head office in the Community can be part of a financial conglomerate, the head of which is outside the Community. These regulated entities should also be subject to equivalent and appropriate supplementary supervisory arrangements which achieve objectives and results similar to those pursued by the provisions of this Directive. To this end, transparency of rules and exchange of information with third-country authorities on all relevant circumstances are of great importance.
(14) Equivalent and appropriate supplementary supervisory arrangements can only be assumed to exist if the third-country supervisory authorities have agreed to cooperate with the competent authorities concerned on the means and objectives of exercising supplementary supervision of the regulated entities of a financial conglomerate.
(15) This Directive does not require the disclosure by competent authorities to a financial conglomerates committee of information which is subject to an obligation of confidentiality under this Directive or other sectoral directives.
(16) Since the objective of the proposed action, namely the establishment of rules on the supplementary supervision of credit institutions, insurance undertakings and investment firms in a financial conglomerate, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale and the effects of the action, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve this objective. Since this Directive defines minimum standards, Member States may lay down stricter rules.
(17) This Directive respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.
(18) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Directive should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(5).
(19) Technical guidance and implementing measures for the rules laid down in this Directive may from time to time be necessary to take account of new developments on financial markets. The Commission should accordingly be empowered to adopt implementing measures, provided that these do not modify the essential elements of this Directive.
(20) The existing sectoral rules for credit institutions, insurance undertakings and investment firms should be supplemented to a minimum level, in particular to avoid regulatory arbitrage between the sectoral rules and those for financial conglomerates. Therefore, First Council Directive 73/239/EEC of 24 July 1973 on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to the taking up and pursuit of the business of direct insurance other than life assurance(6), First Council Directive 79/267/EEC of 5 March 1979 on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to the taking up and pursuit of the business of direct life assurance(7), Council Directive 92/49/EEC of 18 June 1992 on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to direct insurance other than life insurance (third non-life insurance Directive)(8), Council Directive 92/96/EEC of 10 November 1992 on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to direct life assurance (third life insurance Directive)(9), Council Directive 93/6/EEC of 15 March 1993 on the capital adequacy of investments firms and credit institutions(10) and Council Directive 93/22/EEC of 10 May 1993 on investment services in the securities field(11), as well as Directive 98/78/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 October 1998 on the supplementary supervision of insurance undertakings in an insurance group(12) and Directive 2000/12/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 March 2000 relating to the taking up and pursuit of the business of credit institutions(13) should be amended accordingly. The objective of further harmonisation can, however, only be achieved by stages and needs to be based on careful analysis.
(21) In order to assess the need for and prepare any possible future harmonisation of the treatment of asset management companies under sectoral rules, the Commission should report on Member States' practices in this field,
HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:

Article 3
Thresholds for identifying a financial conglomerate
1. For the purposes of determining whether the activities of a group mainly occur in the financial sector, within the meaning of Article 2(14)(c), the ratio of the balance sheet total of the regulated and non-regulated financial sector entities in the group to the balance sheet total of the group as a whole should exceed 40 %.
2. For the purposes of determining whether activities in different financial sectors are significant within the meaning of Article 2(14)(e), for each financial sector the average of the ratio of the balance sheet total of that financial sector to the balance sheet total of the financial sector entities in the group and the ratio of the solvency requirements of the same financial sector to the total solvency requirements of the financial sector entities in the group should exceed 10 %.
For the purposes of this Directive, the smallest financial sector in a financial conglomerate is the sector with the smallest average and the most important financial sector in a financial conglomerate is the sector with the highest average. For the purposes of calculating the average and for the measurement of the smallest and the most important financial sectors, the banking sector and the investment services sector shall be considered together.
3. Cross-sectoral activities shall also be presumed to be significant within the meaning of Article 2(14)(e) if the balance sheet total of the smallest financial sector in the group exceeds EUR 6 billion. If the group does not reach the threshold referred to in paragraph 2, the relevant competent authorities may decide by common agreement not to regard the group as a financial conglomerate, or not to apply the provisions of Articles 7, 8 or 9, if they are of the opinion that the inclusion of the group in the scope of this Directive or the application of such provisions is not necessary or would be inappropriate or misleading with respect to the objectives of supplementary supervision, taking into account, for instance, the fact that:
(a) the relative size of its smallest financial sector does not exceed 5 %, measured either in terms of the average referred to in paragraph 2 or in terms of the balance sheet total or the solvency requirements of such financial sector; or
(b) the market share does not exceed 5 % in any Member State, measured in terms of the balance sheet total in the banking or investment services sectors and in terms of gross premiums written in the insurance sector.
Decisions taken in accordance with this paragraph shall be notified to the other competent authorities concerned.
4. For the application of paragraphs 1, 2 and 3, the relevant competent authorities may by common agreement:
(a) exclude an entity when calculating the ratios, in the cases referred to in Article 6(5);
(b) take into account compliance with the thresholds envisaged in paragraphs 1 and 2 for three consecutive years so as to avoid sudden regime shifts, and disregard such compliance if there are significant changes in the group's structure.
Where a financial conglomerate has been identified according to paragraphs 1, 2 and 3, the decisions referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph shall be taken on the basis of a proposal made by the coordinator of that financial conglomerate.
5. For the application of paragraphs 1 and 2, the relevant competent authorities may, in exceptional cases and by common agreement, replace the criterion based on balance sheet total with one or both of the following parameters or add one or both of these parameters, if they are of the opinion that these parameters are of particular relevance for the purposes of supplementary supervision under this Directive: income structure, off-balance-sheet activities.
6. For the application of paragraphs 1 and 2, if the ratios referred to in those paragraphs fall below 40 % and 10 % respectively for conglomerates already subject to supplementary supervision, a lower ratio of 35 % and 8 % respectively shall apply for the following three years to avoid sudden regime shifts.
Similarly, for the application of paragraph 3, if the balance sheet total of the smallest financial sector in the group falls below EUR 6 billion for conglomerates already subject to supplementary supervision, a lower figure of EUR 5 billion shall apply for the following three years to avoid sudden regime shifts.
During the period referred to in this paragraph, the coordinator may, with the agreement of the other relevant competent authorities, decide that the lower ratios or the lower amount referred to in this paragraph shall cease to apply.
7. The calculations referred to in this Article regarding the balance sheet shall be made on the basis of the aggregated balance sheet total of the entities of the group, according to their annual accounts. For the purposes of this calculation, undertakings in which a participation is held shall be taken into account as regards the amount of their balance sheet total corresponding to the aggregated proportional share held by the group. However, where consolidated accounts are available, they shall be used instead of aggregated accounts.
The solvency requirements referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3 shall be calculated in accordance with the provisions of the relevant sectoral rules.
Article 4
Identifying a financial conglomerate
1. Competent authorities which have authorised regulated entities shall, on the basis of Articles 2, 3 and 5, identify any group that falls under the scope of this Directive.
For this purpose:
- competent authorities which have authorised regulated entities in the group shall, where necessary, cooperate closely,
- if a competent authority is of the opinion that a regulated entity authorised by that competent authority is a member of a group which may be a financial conglomerate, which has not already been identified according to this Directive, the competent authority shall communicate its view to the other competent authorities concerned.
2. The coordinator appointed in accordance with Article 10 shall inform the parent undertaking at the head of a group or, in the absence of a parent undertaking, the regulated entity with the largest balance sheet total in the most important financial sector in a group, that the group has been identified as a financial conglomerate and of the appointment of the coordinator. The coordinator shall also inform the competent authorities which have authorised regulated entities in the group and the competent authorities of the Member State in which the mixed financial holding company has its head office, as well as the Commission.
CHAPTER II
SUPPLEMENTARY SUPERVISION
SECTION 1
SCOPE
Article 5
Scope of supplementary supervision of regulated entities referred to in Article 1
1. Without prejudice to the provisions on supervision contained in the sectoral rules, Member States shall provide for the supplementary supervision of the regulated entities referred to in Article 1, to the extent and in the manner prescribed in this Directive.
2. The following regulated entities shall be subject to supplementary supervision at the level of the financial conglomerate in accordance with Articles 6 to 17:
(a) every regulated entity which is at the head of a financial conglomerate;
(b) every regulated entity, the parent undertaking of which is a mixed financial holding company which has its head office in the Community;
(c) every regulated entity linked with another financial sector entity by a relationship within the meaning of Article 12(1) of Directive 83/349/EEC.
Where a financial conglomerate is a subgroup of another financial conglomerate which meets the requirements of the first subparagraph, Member States may apply Articles 6 to 17 to the regulated entities within the latter group only and any reference in the Directive to the terms group and financial conglomerate will then be understood as referring to that latter group.
3. Every regulated entity which is not subject to supplementary supervision in accordance with paragraph 2, the parent undertaking of which is a regulated entity or a mixed financial holding company, having its head office outside the Community, shall be subject to supplementary supervision at the level of the financial conglomerate to the extent and in the manner prescribed in Article 18.
4. Where persons hold participations or capital ties in one or more regulated entities or exercise significant influence over such entities without holding a participation or capital ties, other than the cases referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3, the relevant competent authorities shall, by common agreement and in conformity with national law, determine whether and to what extent supplementary supervision of the regulated entities is to be carried out, as if they constitute a financial conglomerate.
In order to apply such supplementary supervision, at least one of the entities must be a regulated entity as referred to in Article 1 and the conditions set out in Article 2(14)(d) and (e) must be met. The relevant competent authorities shall take their decision, taking into account the objectives of the supplementary supervision as provided for by this Directive.
For the purposes of applying the first subparagraph to "cooperative groups", the competent authorities must take into account the public financial commitment of these groups with respect to other financial entities.
5. Without prejudice to Article 13, the exercise of supplementary supervision at the level of the financial conglomerate shall in no way imply that the competent authorities are required to play a supervisory role in relation to mixed financial holding companies, third-country regulated entities in a financial conglomerate or unregulated entities in a financial conglomerate, on a stand-alone basis.

1. Without prejudice to the sectoral rules, supplementary supervision of the capital adequacy of the regulated entities in a financial conglomerate shall be exercised in accordance with the rules laid down in Article 9(2) to (5), in Section 3 of this Chapter, and in Annex I.
2. The Member States shall require regulated entities in a financial conglomerate to ensure that own funds are available at the level of the financial conglomerate which are always at least equal to the capital adequacy requirements as calculated in accordance with Annex I.
The Member States shall also require regulated entities to have in place adequate capital adequacy policies at the level of the financial conglomerate.
The requirements referred to in the first and second subparagraphs shall be subject to supervisory overview by the coordinator in accordance with Section 3.
The coordinator shall ensure that the calculation referred to in the first subparagraph is carried out at least once a year, either by the regulated entities or by the mixed financial holding company.
The results of the calculation and the relevant data for the calculation shall be submitted to the coordinator by the regulated entity within the meaning of Article 1 which is at the head of the financial conglomerate, or, where the financial conglomerate is not headed by a regulated entity within the meaning of Article 1, by the mixed financial holding company or by the regulated entity in the financial conglomerate identified by the coordinator after consultation with the other relevant competent authorities and with the financial conglomerate.
3. For the purposes of calculating the capital adequacy requirements referred to in the first subparagraph of paragraph 2, the following entities shall be included in the scope of supplementary supervision in the manner and to the extent defined in Annex I:
(a) a credit institution, a financial institution or an ancillary banking services undertaking within the meaning of Article 1(5) and (23) of Directive 2000/12/EC;
(b) an insurance undertaking, a reinsurance undertaking or an insurance holding company within the meaning of Article 1(i) of Directive 98/78/EC;
(c) an investment firm or a financial institution within the meaning of Article 2(7) of Directive 93/6/EEC;
(d) mixed financial holding companies.
4. When calculating the supplementary capital adequacy requirements with regard to a financial conglomerate by applying method 1 (Accounting consolidation) referred to in Annex I, the own funds and the solvency requirements of the entities in the group shall be calculated by applying the corresponding sectoral rules on the form and extent of consolidation as laid down in particular in Article 54 of Directive 2000/12/EC and Annex I.1.B. of Directive 98/78/EC.
When applying methods 2 or 3 (Deduction and aggregation, Book value/Requirement deduction) referred to in Annex I, the calculation shall take account of the proportional share held by the parent undertaking or undertaking which holds a participation in another entity of the group. "Proportional share" means the proportion of the subscribed capital which is held, directly or indirectly, by that undertaking.
5. The coordinator may decide not to include a particular entity in the scope when calculating the supplementary capital adequacy requirements in the following cases:
(a) if the entity is situated in a third country where there are legal impediments to the transfer of the necessary information, without prejudice to the sectoral rules regarding the obligation of competent authorities to refuse authorisation where the effective exercise of their supervisory functions is prevented;
(b) if the entity is of negligible interest with respect to the objectives of the supplementary supervision of regulated entities in a financial conglomerate;
(c) if the inclusion of the entity would be inappropriate or misleading with respect to the objectives of supplementary supervision.
However, if several entities are to be excluded pursuant to (b) of the first subparagraph, they must nevertheless be included when collectively they are of non-negligible interest.
In the case mentioned in (c) of the first subparagraph the coordinator shall, except in cases of urgency, consult the other relevant competent authorities before taking a decision.
When the coordinator does not include a regulated entity in the scope under one of the cases provided for in (b) and (c) of the first subparagraph, the competent authorities of the Member State in which that entity is situated may ask the entity which is at the head of the financial conglomerate for information which may facilitate their supervision of the regulated entity.
Article 7
Risk concentration
1. Without prejudice to the sectoral rules, supplementary supervision of the risk concentration of regulated entities in a financial conglomerate shall be exercised in accordance with the rules laid down in Article 9(2) to (4), in Section 3 of this Chapter and in Annex II.
2. The Member States shall require regulated entities or mixed financial holding companies to report on a regular basis and at least annually to the coordinator any significant risk concentration at the level of the financial conglomerate, in accordance with the rules laid down in this Article and in Annex II. The necessary information shall be submitted to the coordinator by the regulated entity within the meaning of Article 1 which is at the head of the financial conglomerate or, where the financial conglomerate is not headed by a regulated entity within the meaning of Article 1, by the mixed financial holding company or by the regulated entity in the financial conglomerate identified by the coordinator after consultation with the other relevant competent authorities and with the financial conglomerate.
These risk concentrations shall be subject to supervisory overview by the coordinator in accordance with Section 3.
3. Pending further coordination of Community legislation, Member States may set quantitative limits or allow their competent authorities to set quantitative limits, or take other supervisory measures which would achieve the objectives of supplementary supervision, with regard to any risk concentration at the level of a financial conglomerate.
4. Where a financial conglomerate is headed by a mixed financial holding company, the sectoral rules regarding risk concentration of the most important financial sector in the financial conglomerate, if any, shall apply to that sector as a whole, including the mixed financial holding company.
Article 8
Intra-group transactions
1. Without prejudice to the sectoral rules, supplementary supervision of intra-group transactions of regulated entities in a financial conglomerate shall be exercised in accordance with the rules laid down in Article 9(2) to (4), in Section 3 of this Chapter, and in Annex II.
2. The Member States shall require regulated entities or mixed financial holding companies to report, on a regular basis and at least annually, to the coordinator all significant intra-group transactions of regulated entities within a financial conglomerate, in accordance with the rules laid down in this Article and in Annex II. Insofar as no definition of the thresholds referred to in the last sentence of the first paragraph of Annex II has been drawn up, an intra-group transaction shall be presumed to be significant if its amount exceeds at least 5 % of the total amount of capital adequacy requirements at the level of a financial conglomerate.
The necessary information shall be submitted to the coordinator by the regulated entity within the meaning of Article 1 which is at the head of the financial conglomerate or, where the financial conglomerate is not headed by a regulated entity within the meaning of Article 1, by the mixed financial holding company or by the regulated entity in the financial conglomerate identified by the coordinator after consultation with the other relevant competent authorities and with the financial conglomerate.
These intra-group transactions shall be subject to supervisory overview by the coordinator.
3. Pending further coordination of Community legislation, Member States may set quantitative limits and qualitative requirements or allow their competent authorities to set quantitative limits and qualitative requirements, or take other supervisory measures that would achieve the objectives of supplementary supervision, with regard to intra-group transactions of regulated entities within a financial conglomerate.
4. Where a financial conglomerate is headed by a mixed financial holding company, the sectoral rules regarding intra-group transactions of the most important financial sector in the financial conglomerate shall apply to that sector as a whole, including the mixed financial holding company.
Article 9
Internal control mechanisms and risk management processes
1. The Member States shall require regulated entities to have, in place at the level of the financial conglomerate, adequate risk management processes and internal control mechanisms, including sound administrative and accounting procedures.
2. The risk management processes shall include:
(a) sound governance and management with the approval and periodical review of the strategies and policies by the appropriate governing bodies at the level of the financial conglomerate with respect to all the risks they assume;
(b) adequate capital adequacy policies in order to anticipate the impact of their business strategy on risk profile and capital requirements as determined in accordance with Article 6 and Annex I;
(c) adequate procedures to ensure that their risk monitoring systems are well integrated into their organisation and that all measures are taken to ensure that the systems implemented in all the undertakings included in the scope of supplementary supervision are consistent so that the risks can be measured, monitored and controlled at the level of the financial conglomerate.
3. The internal control mechanisms shall include:
(a) adequate mechanisms as regards capital adequacy to identify and measure all material risks incurred and to appropriately relate own funds to risks;
(b) sound reporting and accounting procedures to identify, measure, monitor and control the intra-group transactions and the risk concentration.
4. The Member States shall ensure that, in all undertakings included in the scope of supplementary supervision pursuant to Article 5, there are adequate internal control mechanisms for the production of any data and information which would be relevant for the purposes of the supplementary supervision.
5. The processes and mechanisms referred to in paragraphs 1 to 4 shall be subject to supervisory overview by the coordinator.
SECTION 3
MEASURES TO FACILITATE SUPPLEMENTARY SUPERVISION
Article 10
Competent authority responsible for exercising supplementary supervision (the coordinator)
1. In order to ensure proper supplementary supervision of the regulated entities in a financial conglomerate, a single coordinator, responsible for coordination and exercise of supplementary supervision, shall be appointed from among the competent authorities of the Member States concerned, including those of the Member State in which the mixed financial holding company has its head office.
2. The appointment shall be based on the following criteria:
(a) where a financial conglomerate is headed by a regulated entity, the task of coordinator shall be exercised by the competent authority which has authorised that regulated entity pursuant to the relevant sectoral rules;
(b) where a financial conglomerate is not headed by a regulated entity, the task of coordinator shall be exercised by the competent authority identified in accordance with the following principles:
(i) where the parent of a regulated entity is a mixed financial holding company, the task of coordinator shall be exercised by the competent authority which has authorised that regulated entity pursuant to the relevant sectoral rules;
(ii) where more than one regulated entity with a head office in the Community have as their parent the same mixed financial holding company, and one of these entities has been authorised in the Member State in which the mixed financial holding company has its head office, the task of coordinator shall be exercised by the competent authority of the regulated entity authorised in that Member State.
Where more than one regulated entity, being active in different financial sectors, have been authorised in the Member State in which the mixed financial holding company has its head office, the task of coordinator shall be exercised by the competent authority of the regulated entity active in the most important financial sector.
Where the financial conglomerate is headed by more than one mixed financial holding company with a head office in different Member States and there is a regulated entity in each of these States, the task of coordinator shall be exercised by the competent authority of the regulated entity with the largest balance sheet total if these entities are in the same financial sector, or by the competent authority of the regulated entity in the most important financial sector;
(iii) where more than one regulated entity with a head office in the Community have as their parent the same mixed financial holding company and none of these entities has been authorised in the Member State in which the mixed financial holding company has its head office, the task of coordinator shall be exercised by the competent authority which authorised the regulated entity with the largest balance sheet total in the most important financial sector;
(iv) where the financial conglomerate is a group without a parent undertaking at the top, or in any other case, the task of coordinator shall be exercised by the competent authority which authorised the regulated entity with the largest balance sheet total in the most important financial sector.
3. In particular cases, the relevant competent authorities may by common agreement waive the criteria referred to in paragraph 2 if their application would be inappropriate, taking into account the structure of the conglomerate and the relative importance of its activities in different countries, and appoint a different competent authority as coordinator. In these cases, before taking their decision, the competent authorities shall give the conglomerate an opportunity to state its opinion on that decision.
Article 11
Tasks of the coordinator
1. The tasks to be carried out by the coordinator with regard to supplementary supervision shall include:
(a) coordination of the gathering and dissemination of relevant or essential information in going concern and emergency situations, including the dissemination of information which is of importance for a competent authority's supervisory task under sectoral rules;
(b) supervisory overview and assessment of the financial situation of a financial conglomerate;
(c) assessment of compliance with the rules on capital adequacy and of risk concentration and intra-group transactions as set out in Articles 6, 7 and 8;
(d) assessment of the financial conglomerate's structure, organisation and internal control system as set out in Article 9;
(e) planning and coordination of supervisory activities in going concern as well as in emergency situations, in cooperation with the relevant competent authorities involved;
(f) other tasks, measures and decisions assigned to the coordinator by this Directive or deriving from the application of this Directive.
In order to facilitate and establish supplementary supervision on a broad legal basis, the coordinator and the other relevant competent authorities, and where necessary other competent authorities concerned, shall have coordination arrangements in place. The coordination arrangements may entrust additional tasks to the coordinator and may specify the procedures for the decision-making process among the relevant competent authorities as referred to in Articles 3, 4, 5(4), 6, 12(2), 16 and 18, and for cooperation with other competent authorities.
2. The coordinator should, when it needs information which has already been given to another competent authority in accordance with the sectoral rules, contact this authority whenever possible in order to prevent duplication of reporting to the various authorities involved in supervision.
3. Without prejudice to the possibility of delegating specific supervisory competences and responsibilities as provided for by Community legislation, the presence of a coordinator entrusted with specific tasks concerning the supplementary supervision of regulated entities in a financial conglomerate shall not affect the tasks and responsibilities of the competent authorities as provided for by the sectoral rules.
Article 12
Cooperation and exchange of information between competent authorities
1. The competent authorities responsible for the supervision of regulated entities in a financial conglomerate and the competent authority appointed as the coordinator for that financial conglomerate shall cooperate closely with each other. Without prejudice to their respective responsibilities as defined under sectoral rules, these authorities, whether or not established in the same Member State, shall provide one another with any information which is essential or relevant for the exercise of the other authorities' supervisory tasks under the sectoral rules and this Directive. In this regard, the competent authorities and the coordinator shall communicate on request all relevant information and shall communicate on their own initiative all essential information.
This cooperation shall at least provide for the gathering and the exchange of information with regard to the following items:
(a) identification of the group structure of all major entities belonging to the financial conglomerate, as well as of the competent authorities of the regulated entities in the group;
(b) the financial conglomerate's strategic policies;
(c) the financial situation of the financial conglomerate, in particular on capital adequacy, intra-group transactions, risk concentration and profitability;
(d) the financial conglomerate's major shareholders and management;
(e) the organisation, risk management and internal control systems at financial conglomerate level;
(f) procedures for the collection of information from the entities in a financial conglomerate, and the verification of that information;
(g) adverse developments in regulated entities or in other entities of the financial conglomerate which could seriously affect the regulated entities;
(h) major sanctions and exceptional measures taken by competent authorities in accordance with sectoral rules or this Directive.
The competent authorities may also exchange with the following authorities such information as may be needed for the performance of their respective tasks, regarding regulated entities in a financial conglomerate, in line with the provisions laid down in the sectoral rules: central banks, the European System of Central Banks and the European Central Bank.
2. Without prejudice to their respective responsibilities as defined under sectoral rules, the competent authorities concerned shall, prior to their decision, consult each other with regard to the following items, where these decisions are of importance for other competent authorities' supervisory tasks:
(a) changes in the shareholder, organisational or management structure of regulated entities in a financial conglomerate, which require the approval or authorisation of competent authorities;
(b) major sanctions or exceptional measures taken by competent authorities.
A competent authority may decide not to consult in cases of urgency or where such consultation may jeopardise the effectiveness of the decisions. In this case, the competent authority shall, without delay, inform the other competent authorities.
3. The coordinator may invite the competent authorities of the Member State in which a parent undertaking has its head office, and which do not themselves exercise the supplementary supervision pursuant to Article 10, to ask the parent undertaking for any information which would be relevant for the exercise of its coordination tasks as laid down in Article 11, and to transmit that information to the coordinator.
Where the information referred to in Article 14(2) has already been given to a competent authority in accordance with sectoral rules, the competent authorities responsible for exercising supplementary supervision may apply to the first-mentioned authority to obtain the information.
4. Member States shall authorise the exchange of the information between their competent authorities and between their competent authorities and other authorities, as referred to in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3. The collection or possession of information with regard to an entity within a financial conglomerate which is not a regulated entity shall not in any way imply that the competent authorities are required to play a supervisory role in relation to these entities on a stand-alone basis.
Information received in the framework of supplementary supervision, and in particular any exchange of information between competent authorities and between competent authorities and other authorities which is provided for in this Directive, shall be subject to the provisions on professional secrecy and communication of confidential information laid down in the sectoral rules.
Article 13
Management body of mixed financial holding companies
Member States shall require that persons who effectively direct the business of a mixed financial holding company are of sufficiently good repute and have sufficient experience to perform those duties.
Article 14
Access to information
1. Member States shall ensure that there are no legal impediments within their jurisdiction preventing the natural and legal persons included within the scope of supplementary supervision, whether or not a regulated entity, from exchanging amongst themselves any information which would be relevant for the purposes of supplementary supervision.
2. Member States shall provide that, when approaching the entities in a financial conglomerate, whether or not a regulated entity, either directly or indirectly, their competent authorities responsible for exercising supplementary supervision shall have access to any information which would be relevant for the purposes of supplementary supervision.
Article 15
Verification
Where, in applying this Directive, competent authorities wish in specific cases to verify the information concerning an entity, whether or not regulated, which is part of a financial conglomerate and is situated in another Member State, they shall ask the competent authorities of that other Member State to have the verification carried out.
The authorities which receive such a request shall, within the framework of their competences, act upon it either by carrying out the verification themselves, by allowing an auditor or expert to carry it out, or by allowing the authority which made the request to carry it out itself.
The competent authority which made the request may, if it so wishes, participate in the verification when it does not carry out the verification itself.
Article 16
Enforcement measures
If the regulated entities in a financial conglomerate do not comply with the requirements referred to in Articles 6 to 9 or where the requirements are met but solvency may nevertheless be jeopardised or where the intra-group transactions or the risk concentrations are a threat to the regulated entities' financial position, the necessary measures shall be required in order to rectify the situation as soon as possible:
- by the coordinator with respect to the mixed financial holding company,
- by the competent authorities with respect to the regulated entities; to that end, the coordinator shall inform those competent authorities of its findings.
Without prejudice to Article 17(2), Member States may determine what measures may be taken by their competent authorities with respect to mixed financial holding companies.
The competent authorities involved, including the coordinator, shall where appropriate coordinate their supervisory actions.
Article 17
Additional powers of the competent authorities
1. Pending further harmonisation between sectoral rules, the Member States shall provide that their competent authorities shall have the power to take any supervisory measure deemed necessary in order to avoid or to deal with the circumvention of sectoral rules by regulated entities in a financial conglomerate.
2. Without prejudice to their criminal law provisions, Member States shall ensure that penalties or measures aimed at ending observed breaches or the causes of such breaches may be imposed on mixed financial holding companies, or their effective managers, which infringe laws, regulations or administrative provisions enacted to implement this Directive. In certain cases, such measures may require the intervention of the courts. The competent authorities shall cooperate closely to ensure that such penalties or measures produce the desired results.
SECTION 4
THIRD COUNTRIES
Article 18
Parent undertakings outside the Community
1. Without prejudice to the sectoral rules, in the case referred to in Article 5(3), competent authorities shall verify whether the regulated entities, the parent undertaking of which has its head office outside the Community, are subject to supervision by a third-country competent authority, which is equivalent to that provided for by the provisions of this Directive on the supplementary supervision of regulated entities referred to in Article 5(2). The verification shall be carried out by the competent authority which would be the coordinator if the criteria set out in Article 10(2) were to apply, on the request of the parent undertaking or of any of the regulated entities authorised in the Community or on its own initiative. That competent authority shall consult the other relevant competent authorities, and shall take into account any applicable guidance prepared by the Financial Conglomerates Committee in accordance with Article 21(5). For this purpose the competent authority shall consult the Committee before taking a decision.
2. In the absence of equivalent supervision referred to in paragraph 1, Member States shall apply to the regulated entities, by analogy, the provisions concerning the supplementary supervision of regulated entities referred to in Article 5(2). As an alternative, competent authorities may apply one of the methods set out in paragraph 3.
3. Member States shall allow their competent authorities to apply other methods which ensure appropriate supplementary supervision of the regulated entities in a financial conglomerate. These methods must be agreed by the coordinator, after consultation with the other relevant competent authorities. The competent authorities may in particular require the establishment of a mixed financial holding company which has its head office in the Community, and apply this Directive to the regulated entities in the financial conglomerate headed by that holding company. The methods must achieve the objectives of the supplementary supervision as defined in this Directive and must be notified to the other competent authorities involved and the Commission.
Article 19
Cooperation with third-country competent authorities
1. Article 25(1) and (2) of Directive 2000/12/EC and Article 10a of Directive 98/78/EC shall apply mutatis mutandis to the negotiation of agreements with one or more third countries regarding the means of exercising supplementary supervision of regulated entities in a financial conglomerate.
2. The Commission, the Banking Advisory Committee, the Insurance Committee and the Financial Conglomerates Committee shall examine the outcome of the negotiations referred to in paragraph 1 and the resulting situation.

Competent authorities shall require credit institutions to have in place adequate risk management processes and internal control mechanisms, including sound reporting and accounting procedures, in order to identify, measure, monitor and control transactions with their parent mixed-activity holding company and its subsidiaries appropriately.

The verification shall be carried out by the competent authority which would be responsible for consolidated supervision if the fourth subparagraph were to apply, at the request of the parent undertaking or of any of the regulated entities authorised in the Community or on its own initiative. That competent authority shall consult the other competent authorities involved.
The Banking Advisory Committee may give general guidance as to whether the consolidated supervision arrangements of competent authorities in third countries are likely to achieve the objectives of consolidated supervision as defined in this Chapter, in relation to credit institutions, the parent undertaking of which has its head office outside the Community. The Committee shall keep any such guidance under review and take into account any changes to the consolidated supervision arrangements applied by such competent authorities.
As an alternative, Member States shall allow their competent authorities to apply other appropriate supervisory techniques which achieve the objectives of the supervision on a consolidated basis of credit institutions. Those methods must be agreed upon by the competent authority which would be responsible for consolidated supervision, after consultation with the other competent authorities involved. Competent authorities may in particular require the establishment of a financial holding company which has its head office in the Community, and apply the provisions on consolidated supervision to the consolidated position of that financial holding company. The methods must achieve the objectives of consolidated supervision as defined in this Chapter and must be notified to the other competent authorities involved and the Commission."
CHAPTER V
ASSET MANAGEMENT COMPANIES
Article 30
Asset management companies
Pending further coordination of sectoral rules, Member States shall provide for the inclusion of asset management companies:
(a) in the scope of consolidated supervision of credit institutions and investment firms, and/or in the scope of supplementary supervision of insurance undertakings in an insurance group; and
(b) where the group is a financial conglomerate, in the scope of supplementary supervision within the meaning of this Directive.
For the application of the first paragraph, Member States shall provide, or give their competent authorities the power to decide, according to which sectoral rules (banking sector, insurance sector or investment services sector) asset management companies shall be included in the consolidated and/or supplementary supervision referred to in (a) of the first paragraph. For the purposes of this provision, the relevant sectoral rules regarding the form and extent of the inclusion of financial institutions (where asset management companies are included in the scope of consolidated supervision of credit institutions and investment firms) and of reinsurance undertakings (where asset management companies are included in the scope of supplementary supervision of insurance undertakings) shall apply mutatis mutandis to asset management companies. For the purposes of supplementary supervision referred to in (b) of the first paragraph, the asset management company shall be treated as part of whichever sector it is included in by virtue of (a) of the first paragraph.
Where an asset management company is part of a financial conglomerate, any reference to the notion of regulated entity and any reference to the notion of competent authorities and relevant competent authorities shall therefore, for the purposes of this Directive, be understood as including, respectively, asset management companies and the competent authorities responsible for the supervision of asset management companies. This applies mutatis mutandis as regards groups referred to in (a) of the first paragraph.

Commission Directive 2002/97/EC
of 16 December 2002
amending the Annexes to Council Directives 86/362/EEC, 86/363/EEC and 90/642/EEC as regards the fixing of maximum levels for pesticide residues (2,4-D, triasulfuron and thifensulfuron methyl) in and on cereals, foodstuffs of animal origin and certain products of plant origin, including fruit and vegetables
(Text with EEA relevance)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 86/362/EEC of 24 July 1986 on the fixing of maximum levels for pesticide residues in and on cereals(1), as last amended by Commission Directive 2002/79/EC(2), and in particular Article 10 thereof,
Having regard to Council Directive 86/363/EEC of 24 July 1986 on the fixing of maximum levels for pesticide residues in and on foodstuffs of animal origin(3), as last amended by Directive 2002/79/EC, and in particular Article 10 thereof,
Having regard to Council Directive 90/642/EEC of 27 November 1990 on fixing of maximum levels for pesticide residues in and on certain products of plant origin including fruit and vegetables(4), as last amended by Directive 2002/79/EC, and in particular Article 7 thereof,
Having regard to Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market(5), as last amended by Commission Directive 2002/81/EC(6), and in particular Article 4(1)(f) thereof,
WHEREAS:
(1) The existing active substances 2,4-D, triasulfuron and thifensulfuron methyl, (the active substances concerned), were included in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC by Commission Directives 2001/103/EC(7), 2000/66/EC(8) and 2001/99/EC(9), respectively, for use as herbicides, but without specifying particular conditions having an impact on crops which may be treated with plant protection products containing this active substance.
(2) The inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC of these active substances was based on the assessment of the information submitted concerning the proposed use. Information relating to this use has been submitted by certain Member States in accordance with Article 4(1)(f) of Directive 91/414/EEC. The information available has been reviewed and is sufficient to allow certain maximum residue levels (MRLs) to be fixed.
(3) Where no Community MRL or provisional MRL exists, Member States are to establish a national provisional MRL in accordance with Article 4(1)(f) of Directive 91/414/EEC before plant protection products containing this active substance may be authorised.
(4) With respect to the inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC of the active substance concerned, the related technical and scientific evaluations were finalised in the form of the Commission review report. The report was finalised on 2 October 2001 for 2,4-D, on 13 July 2000 for triasulfuron and on 29 June 2001 for thifensulfuron methyl. The reports fixed the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) for 2,4-D at 0,05 mg/kg bw/day, for triasulfuron at 0,01 mg/kg bw/day and for thifensulfuron methyl at 0,01 mg/kg bw/day. The lifetime exposure of consumers of food products treated with the active substances concerned has been assessed and evaluated in accordance with Community procedures. Account has also been taken of guidelines published by the World Health Organisation(10) and the opinion of the Scientific Committee for Plants(11) on the methodology employed. It is concluded that MRLs proposed will not lead to those ADIs being exceeded. No acute toxic effects requiring the setting of an Acute Reference Dose were noted during the evaluations and discussions preceding the inclusion of the active substances concerned in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC.
(5) In order to ensure that the consumer is adequately protected from exposure to residues in or on products for which no authorisations have been granted, it is prudent to set provisional MRLs at the lower limit of analytical determination for all such products covered by Directives 86/362/EEC, 86/363/EEC and 90/642/EEC.
(6) The setting at Community level of such provisional MRLs does not prevent the Member States from establishing provisional maximum residue levels in accordance with Article 4(1)(f) of Directive 91/414/EEC and Annex VI thereto. It is considered that a period of four years is sufficient to permit the development of further uses of the active substance concerned. The provisional MRLs should then become definitive.
(7) The Annexes to Directives 86/362/EEC, 86/363/EEC and 90/642/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.
(8) The Commission notified this Directive in draft form to the World Trade Organisation and the comments received have been considered in finalising the Directive. The possibility of fixing import tolerance MRLs for specific pesticide/crop combinations will be examined by the Commission on the basis of acceptable data submitted.
(9) This Directive is in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,
HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:
Article 1
The following maximum pesticide residue level are added to Part A of Annex II to Directive 86/362/EEC:

They shall apply these provisions with effect from 1 July 2003.

Moreover, where there is more than one representative market in a Member State the arithmetical or, if necessary, the weighted average of quotations recorded on these markets should be taken.
(4) The prices recorded on the market shall be based on the prices, excluding value added tax, of carcasses, but with no deductions authorised in respect of other charges. Market prices should be recorded in respect of the "carcass weight" as defined in Commission Decision 94/434/EC of 30 May 1994 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Directive 93/25/EEC as regards the statistical surveys to be carried out by Member States on sheep and goat population and production(6), as last amended by Decision 1999/47/EC(7). However, it should be permitted that this definition be not used in the case of carcasses of young lambs weighing between 9 and 16 kilograms, so that market practices, whereby whole carcasses marketed with head and offals command a greater commercial value, can be taken into account.
(5) In certain Member States prices relate to prices for live animals. These prices should then be converted by means of appropriate coefficients. However, in regions where the individual assessment of live animals is carried out in order to estimate carcass weight the conversion may be based on that assessment.
(6) In order to explain the basis on which Member States compile prices, they should notify the Commission with regard to the representative markets chosen and the categories of carcasses and the weighting or relative importance of those elements used for the calculation of the prices.
(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Sheep and Goats,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
1. Member States whose sheep meat production exceeds 200 tonnes per year shall communicate to the Commission, each Thursday at the latest, the prices of fresh or chilled carcasses of lambs and ewes.
2. The prices shall be those recorded in the quotation areas referred to in Article 12 of Regulation (EC) No 2529/2001 of Member States that fulfil the requirements set out in paragraph 1. They shall be wholesale prices recorded by those Member States on the representative market or markets during the week preceding the week in which the information is given. The representative market or markets shall be determined by the Member States mentioned above. The prices shall be calculated on the basis of market prices, ex value added tax.
Article 2
1. Market prices shall be recorded in respect of the "carcass weight" within the meaning of Decision 94/434/EC.
Where prices are recorded according to different categories of carcass the price on the representative market shall be equal to the average, weighted by coefficients fixed by Member States to reflect the relative importance of each category, of the prices recorded for the said categories during a seven-day period at the wholesale stage.
2. In the case of lamb carcasses weighing up to 16 kilograms, and in accordance with normal commercial practice, prices may be recorded before evisceration and removal of the head.
Where prices are recorded on a liveweight basis, the prices per kilogram liveweight shall be divided by a maximum conversion coefficient of 0,5. However, where normal practice is to include head and offals with the carcass, for lambs weighing up to 28 kilograms liveweight the Member States may fix a higher coefficient.
In regions where price recording is based on the individual assessment of the weight of lamb carcasses, the conversion shall be based on that assessment.
Article 3
1. Where markets are held more than once during the seven-day period referred to in Article 2(1), the price of each category shall be the arithmetical average of the quotations recorded during each market.
2. Where there are several representative markets in a quotation area the price for that quotation area shall be the average of the prices recorded on the said markets, weighted by coefficients fixed by the Member States to reflect the relative importance of each market or of each category.
3. However, where no information is available the prices on the representative markets of that Member State shall be determined by reference in particular to the last prices known.
Article 4
Member States shall notify the Commission by 1 March 2002 of:
(a) the representative markets of each quotation area;
(b) the categories of lamb carcasses;
(c) the weighting and conversion coefficients referred to in Articles 2 and 3.
Member States shall notify the Commission of any changes in the arrangements within a period of one month after any such changes.

Regulation (EC) No 1406/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council
of 27 June 2002
establishing a European Maritime Safety Agency
(Text with EEA relevance)
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 80(2) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee(2),
Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions(3),
Acting in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 251 of the Treaty(4),
Whereas:
(1) A large number of legislative measures have been adopted in the Community in order to enhance safety and prevent pollution in maritime transport. In order to be effective, such legislation must be applied in a proper and uniform manner throughout the Community. This will ensure a level playing field, reduce the distortion of competition resulting from the economic advantages enjoyed by non-complying ships and will reward the serious maritime players.
(2) Certain tasks currently done at Community or national level could be executed by a specialised expert body. Indeed, there is a need for technical and scientific support and a high level of stable expertise to properly apply the Community legislation in the fields of maritime safety and ship pollution prevention, to monitor its implementation and to evaluate the effectiveness of the measures in place. There is a need therefore, within the Community's existing institutional structure and balance of powers, to establish a European Maritime Safety Agency ("the Agency").
(3) In general terms, the Agency should represent the technical body providing the Community with the necessary means to act effectively to enhance overall maritime safety and ship pollution prevention rules. The Agency should assist the Commission in the continuous process of updating and developing Community legislation in the field of maritime safety and prevention of pollution by ships and should provide the necessary support to ensure the convergent and effective implementation of such legislation throughout the Community by assisting the Commission in performing the tasks assigned to the latter by existing and future Community legislation on maritime safety and ship pollution prevention.
(4) For the proper achievement of the purposes for which the Agency is established, it is appropriate that the Agency carries out a number of other important tasks aimed at enhancing maritime safety and ship pollution prevention in the waters of the Member States. In this respect, the Agency should work with Member States to organise appropriate training activities on port State control and flag State related issues and to provide technical assistance related to the implementation of Community legislation. It should facilitate cooperation between the Member States and the Commission as provided for in Directive 2002/59/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 June 2002 establishing a Community vessel traffic monitoring and information system and repealing Council Directive 93/75/EEC(5), namely by developing and operating any information system necessary for the objectives of that Directive, and in the activities concerning the investigations related to serious maritime accidents. It should provide the Commission and the Member States with objective, reliable and comparable information and data on maritime safety and on ship pollution prevention to enable them to take any necessary initiatives to enhance the measures in place and to evaluate their effectiveness. It should place the Community maritime safety know-how at the disposal of the States applying for accession. It should be open to the participation of these States and to other third countries which have concluded agreements with the Community whereby they adopt and implement Community legislation in the field of maritime safety and prevention of pollution by ships.
(5) The Agency should favour the establishment of better cooperation between the Member States and should develop and disseminate best practices in the Community. This in turn should contribute to enhancing the overall maritime safety system in the Community as well as reducing the risk of maritime accidents, marine pollution and the loss of human lives at sea.
(6) In order properly to carry out the tasks entrusted to the Agency, it is appropriate that its officials carry out visits to the Member States in order to monitor the overall functioning of the Community maritime safety and ship pollution prevention system. The visits should be carried out in accordance with a policy to be established by the Agency's Administrative Board and should be facilitated by the authorities of the Member States.
(7) The Agency should apply the relevant Community legislation concerning public access to documents and the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data. It should give the public and any interested party objective, reliable and easily understandable information with regard to its work.
(8) For the contractual liability of the Agency, which is governed by the law applicable to the contracts concluded by the Agency, the Court of Justice should have jurisdiction to give judgment pursuant to any arbitration clause contained in the contract. The Court of Justice should also have jurisdiction in disputes relating to compensation for any damage arising from the non-contractual liability of the Agency.
(9) In order to effectively ensure the accomplishment of the functions of the Agency, the Member States and the Commission should be represented on an Administrative Board entrusted with the necessary powers to establish the budget, verify its execution, adopt the appropriate financial rules, establish transparent working procedures for decision making by the Agency, approve its work programme, examine requests for technical assistance from Member States, define a policy for visits to the Member States and appoint the Executive Director. In the light of the highly technical and scientific mission and tasks of the Agency, it is appropriate for the Administrative Board to consist of one representative of each Member State and four representatives of the Commission, being members with a high level of expertise. In order further to ensure the highest level of expertise and experience in the Administrative Board and with a view to involving the sectors most closely concerned in the tasks of the Agency, the Commission should nominate independent professionals from these sectors as board members without the right to vote, on the basis of their personal merit and experience in the field of maritime safety and prevention of pollution by ships and not as representatives of particular professional organisations.
(10) The good functioning of the Agency requires that its Executive Director be appointed on the grounds of merit and documented administrative and managerial skills, as well as competence and experience relevant for maritime safety and prevention of pollution by ships and that he/she performs his/her duties with complete independence and flexibility as to the organisation of the internal functioning of the Agency. To this end, the Executive Director should prepare and take all necessary steps to ensure the proper accomplishment of the working programme of the Agency, should prepare each year a draft general report to be submitted to the Administrative Board, should draw up estimates of the revenues and expenditure of the Agency and should implement the budget.
(11) In order to guarantee the full autonomy and independence of the Agency, it is considered necessary to grant it an autonomous budget whose revenue comes essentially from a contribution from the Community.
(12) Over the past years, as more decentralised agencies have been created, the budgetary authority has looked to improve transparency and control over the management of the Community funding allocated to them, in particular concerning the budgetisation of the fees, financial control, power of discharge, pension scheme contributions and the internal budgetary procedure (code of conduct). In a similar way, Regulation (EC) No 1073/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 May 1999 concerning investigations conducted by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF)(6) should apply without restriction to the Agency, which should accede to the Interinstitutional Agreement of 25 May 1999 between the European Parliament, the Council of the European Union and the Commission of the European Communities concerning internal investigations by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF)(7).
(13) Within five years from the date of the Agency having taken up its responsibilities, the Administrative Board should commission an independent external evaluation in order to assess the impact of this Regulation, the Agency and its working practices on establishing a high level of maritime safety and prevention of pollution by ships,
HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:

Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council
of 3 October 2002
laying down health rules concerning animal by-products not intended for human consumption
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 152(4)(b) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee(2),
Having consulted the Committee of the Regions,
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty(3), in the light of the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee on 12 September 2002.
Whereas:
(1) Council Directive 90/667/EEC of 27 November 1990 laying down the veterinary rules for the disposal and processing of animal waste, for its placing on the market and for the prevention of pathogens in feedingstuffs of animal or fish origin and amending Directive 90/425/EEC(4) established the principle that all animal waste, regardless of its source, may be used for the production of feed material following appropriate treatment.
(2) The Scientific Steering Committee has adopted a number of opinions since the adoption of that Directive. Their main conclusion is that animal by-products derived from animals not fit for human consumption following health inspection should not enter the feed chain.
(3) In the light of those scientific opinions, a distinction should be drawn between the measures to be implemented, depending on the nature of animal by-products used. The possible uses of certain animal materials should be limited. Rules should be laid down for the use of animal by-products other than in feed and for their disposal.
(4) In the light of the experience gained in recent years, it is appropriate to clarify the relationship between Directive 90/667/EEC and Community environmental legislation. This Regulation should not affect the application of existing environmental legislation or hinder the development of new rules on environmental protection, particularly as regards biodegradable waste. In this regard, the Commission has given a commitment that by the end of the year 2004 a Directive on biowaste, including catering waste, will be prepared with the aim of establishing rules on safe use, recovery, recycling and disposal of this waste and of controlling potential contamination.
(5) The International Scientific Conference on Meat-and-Bone Meal organised by the Commission and the European Parliament, held in Brussels on 1 and 2 July 1997, initiated a debate concerning the production and feeding of meat-and-bone meal. The Conference called for further reflection on the future policy in this area. In November 1997, to launch the widest possible public debate about the future of the Community's feed legislation, the Commission finalised a consultation paper on meat-and-bone meal. Following that consultation, it appears that there is a general recognition of the need to amend Directive 90/667/EEC to bring it in line with the new scientific information.
(6) The European Parliament, in its resolution of 16 November 2000 on BSE and safety of animal feed(5), called for a ban on the use of animal protein in feed until the present Regulation enters into force.
(7) Scientific advice suggests that the practice of feeding an animal species with proteins derived from the bodies, or parts of bodies, of the same species presents a risk of spreading disease. As a precautionary measure, this practice should therefore be prohibited. Implementing rules should be adopted to ensure the necessary separation of animal by-products destined for use in feed at every stage of processing, storage and transport. However, there should be scope to establish derogations from this general prohibition in relation to fish and fur animals if justified by scientific advice.
(8) Catering waste containing products of animal origin can also be a vector for the spread of disease. All catering waste generated from means of transport operating internationally should be disposed of safely. Catering waste produced within the Community should not be used for the feeding of farmed animals other than fur animals.
(9) From October 1996, the Food and Veterinary Office of the Commission (FVO) carried out a number of rounds of inspections in Member States, to assess the presence and management of main risk factors and surveillance procedures with regard to BSE. Part of the assessment covered the systems of commercial rendering and other methods of animal waste disposal. General conclusions and a number of recommendations were drawn up following those inspections, with particular reference to the traceability of animal by-products.
(10) To avoid any risk of dispersal of pathogens and/or residues, animal by-products should be processed, stored and kept separated in an approved and supervised plant designated by the Member State concerned or be disposed of in a suitable manner. In certain circumstances, especially when it is justified by distance, time of transport, or capacity problems, the designated processing, incineration or co-incineration plant could be located in another Member State.
(11) Directive 2000/76/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 December 2000 on the incineration of waste(6) does not apply to incineration plants if the waste treated consists solely of animal carcases. It is necessary to lay down minimum requirements for such incineration plants to protect animal and public health. Pending the adoption of Community requirements, Member States may adopt environmental legislation for such plants. Less strict requirements should apply to low-capacity incineration plants, such as those located on farms and at pet crematoria, to reflect the lower risk posed by the material treated and to avoid unnecessary transport of animal by-products.
(12) Specific rules should be laid down on controls for processing plants, with particular reference to detailed procedures for the validation of processing methods and for self-supervision of production.
(13) Derogations from the rules on the use of animal by-products may be appropriate to facilitate the feeding of animals not destined for human consumption. The competent authorities should control such uses.
(14) Derogations may also be appropriate to permit the disposal of animal by-products on site in controlled circumstances. The Commission should receive the information necessary to enable it to monitor the situation and to lay down implementing rules if appropriate.
(15) Community inspections should be carried out in the Member States to ensure uniform implementation of the health requirements. Such inspections should also include audit procedures.
(16) The basis for Community legislation on health issues is sound science. To this end, the relevant scientific committees set up by Commission Decisions 97/404/EC(7) and 97/579/EC(8) should be consulted wherever necessary. In particular, further scientific advice is required on the use of products of animal origin in organic fertilisers and soil improvers. Pending the adoption of Community rules in the light of this advice, Member States may maintain or adopt national rules that are stricter than those envisaged in this Regulation, provided that such rules comply with other applicable Community legislation.
(17) A wide variety of approaches exists in Member States as regards the financial support for processing, collection, storage and disposal of animal by-products. To ensure that the conditions of competition between agricultural products are not affected, it is necessary to carry out an analysis and, if necessary, to take appropriate measures at Community level.
(18) In the light of the above, a fundamental revision of the Community rules applicable to animal by-products appears to be necessary.
(19) Animal by-products not destined for human consumption (in particular processed animal protein, rendered fats, petfood, hides and skins and wool) are included in the list of products in Annex I to the Treaty. The placing on the market of such products constitutes an important source of income for part of the farming population. To ensure rational development in this sector and increase productivity, animal health and public health rules for the products in question should be laid down at Community level. Given the significant risks of the spread of diseases to which animals are exposed, particular requirements should apply to the placing on the market of certain animal by-products, particularly in regions with a high health status.
(20) To ensure that products imported from non-member countries are of a hygiene standard which is at least equal or equivalent to the hygiene standard applied by the Community, a system of approval should be introduced for non-member countries and their establishments, together with a Community inspection procedure to ensure that the conditions for such approval are observed. The importation from third countries of petfood and raw material for petfood can take place subject to conditions different from those applicable to such material produced in the Community, in particular as regards the guarantees required concerning the residues of substances prohibited in accordance with Council Directive 96/22/EC of 29 April 1996 concerning the prohibition on the use in stock farming of certain substances having a hormonal or thyrostatic action and of beta-agonists, and repealing Directives 81/602/EEC, 88/146/EEC and 88/299/EEC(9). To ensure that such petfood and raw material are used only for their intended purpose, it is necessary to lay down appropriate control measures on importation of material covered by such derogations.
(21) Animal by-products that pass through the Community in transit, and those originating in the Community and destined for export, can create a risk for animal and public health within the Community. Certain requirements laid down by this Regulation should therefore apply to such movements.
(22) The accompanying document for products of animal origin is the best way of satisfying the competent authority of the place of destination that a consignment complies with the provisions of this Regulation. The health certificate should be maintained for the purposes of verifying the destination of certain imported products.
(23) Council Directive 92/118/EEC of 17 December 1992 laying down animal health and public health requirements governing trade and imports into the Community of products not subject to the said requirements laid down in specific Community rules referred to in Annex A(I) to Directive 89/662/EEC and, as regards pathogens, to Directive 90/425/EEC(10) pursues the abovementioned objectives.
(24) The Council and the Commission have adopted several Decisions implementing Directives 90/667/EEC and 92/118/EEC. Furthermore, Directive 92/118/EEC has been substantially amended and further amendments are to be made. Consequently, a great number of Community acts currently regulate the animal by-products sector and there is a need for simplification.
(25) Such simplification will lead to more transparency with regard to specific health rules for products of animal origin not destined for human consumption. Simplification of the specific health legislation must not lead to deregulation. It is therefore necessary to maintain and, to ensure public and animal health protection, to tighten the detailed health rules for products of animal origin not destined for human consumption.
(26) The products concerned should be subject to the rules for veterinary checks, including checks by experts from the Commission, and any protective measures laid down by Council Directive 90/425/EEC of 26 June 1990 concerning veterinary and zootechnical checks applicable in intra-Community trade in certain live animals and products with a view to the completion of the internal market(11).
(27) Effective checks should be carried out on products imported into the Community. This can be achieved by implementing the controls laid down in Council Directive 97/78/EC of 18 December 1997 laying down the principles governing the organisation of veterinary checks on products entering the Community from non-member countries(12).
(28) Directive 90/667/EEC, Council Decision 95/348/EC of 22 June 1995 laying down the veterinary and animal health rules applicable in the United Kingdom and Ireland to the treatment of certain types of waste intended to be marketed locally as feedstuffs for certain animal categories(13) and Council Decision 1999/534/EC of 19 July 1999 on measures applying to the processing of certain animal waste to protect against transmissible spongiform encephalopathies and amending Commission Decision 97/735/EC(14) should therefore be repealed.
(29) To take account of technical and scientific progress, close and effective cooperation should be ensured between the Commission and the Member States within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health set up by Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2002 laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety(15).
(30) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(16),
HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:

Commission Regulation (EC) No 1802/2002
of 10 October 2002
correcting Regulation (EC) No 1282/2002 amending Annexes to Council Directive 92/65/EEC laying down animal health requirements governing trade in and imports into the Community of animals, semen, ova and embryos not subject to animal health requirements laid down in specific Community rules referred to in Annex A(1) to Directive 90/425/EEC
(Text with EEA relevance)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 92/65/EEC of 13 July 1992 laying down animal health requirements governing trade in and imports into the Community of animals, semen, ova and embryos not subject to animal health requirements laid down in specific Community rules referred to in Annex A(1) to Directive 90/425/EEC(1), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1282/2002(2), and in particular Article 22 thereof.
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 1282/2002 was adopted on 15 July 2002 to amend Directive 92/65/EEC.
(2) In order to ensure that there was an appropriate period for the amended provisions to be implemented in all Member States, a date of application of Regulation (EC) No 1282/2002 should have been laid down.
(3) However, during the adoption process the provision laying down that date was omitted.
(4) Regulation (EC) No 1282/2002 should therefore be corrected accordingly.
(5) It is necessary for the correction to take effect from the date of entry into force of Regulation (EC) No 1282/2002.
(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
In Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 1282/2002, the following second paragraph is inserted: "It shall apply from 1 March 2003."
Article 2
This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
Council Regulation (EC) No 1881/2002
of 14 October 2002
rectifying Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 relative to the starting date of the transitional period for the recognition of producer organisations
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 37 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament(2),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee(3),
Whereas:
(1) Pursuant to Article 13(1) of Council Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 of 28 October 1996 on the common organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables(4), a transitional period of two years, starting from its date of entry into force, in which the provisions of Title IV of the aforementioned Regulation would apply, was granted to producer organisations recognised under Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72(5), who did not meet the requirements for recognition of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96. This two-year transitional period could be extended to five years subject to acceptance by the relevant Member State of an action plan presented by the producer organisation in order to comply with all requirements provided for by Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 for being granted recognition by that Member State.
(2) Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 defines in Article 13(1) the starting date of the two- and five-year transitional periods as the date of entry into force of the Regulation, namely 21 November 1996. This date is the result of an error; as a matter of fact, eligibility for transitional measures as from the date of entry into force of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 would have been meaningless since Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72 was still in force until 31 December 1996. Instead, the starting date for the transitional periods should have been the date of application of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96.
(3) It is therefore appropriate to rectify the error in Article 13(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96. Since the effects of that error could have negatively affected producer organisations having benefitted from the said transitional periods, it is appropriate to apply the corresponding provisions as from the date of application of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
Article 13(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 shall be replaced by: "1. Producer organisations recognised under Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72 before the entry into force of this Regulation and which are unable to qualify for recognition under Article 11 of this Regulation without a transitional period may continue to operate under the provisions of Title IV for two years as from 1 January 1997, provided that they remain in compliance with the requirements of the said Articles of Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72."
Article 2
This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
Commission Regulation (EC) No 1921/2002
of 28 October 2002
amending Regulation (EEC) No 3149/92 laying down detailed rules for the supply of food from intervention stocks for the benefit of the most deprived persons in the Community
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 3730/87 of 10 December 1987 laying down the general rules for the supply of food from intervention stocks to designated organisations for distribution to the most deprived persons in the Community(1), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 2535/95(2), and in particular Article 6 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3149/92(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1098/2001(4), provides that implementation of the annual plan for the distribution of the food products to the most deprived persons shall run from 1 October to 30 September of the following year. For the sake of the sound management of intervention stocks, provision should be made to ensure that the products to be distributed are withdrawn from intervention stocks by 31 August of the year of distribution at the latest.
(2) Article 5 of Regulation (EEC) No 3149/92 sets the accounting value of the products made available. This provision should be adapted to take account of changes in the intervention scheme affecting the common organisation of the market in beef and veal.
(3) Article 8 of Regulation (EEC) No 3149/92 should be repealed, since it no longer applies as the transport costs concerned are reimbursed on the basis of expenditure incurred.
(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinions of the Management Committees concerned,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
Regulation (EEC) No 3149/92 is amended as follows:
1. the following second subparagraph is added to Article 3(1):"Withdrawal of the products from intervention stocks shall take place from 1 October to 31 August of the following year.";
2. Article 5 is replaced by the following:
"Article 5
1. For EAGGF Guarantee Section accounting purposes, and notwithstanding the provisions of Article 8 of Regulation (EEC) No 1883/78(5), the accounting value of the products made available from intervention under this Regulation shall be the intervention price applicable on 1 October of each year.
In the case of beef, the accounting value of the products made available shall be the intervention price applicable on 30 June 2002. That price shall be subject to the coefficients set out in the Annex.
For the Member States which have not adopted the euro, the accounting value of intervention products shall be converted into national currency at the exchange rate applicable on 1 October.
2. Where intervention products are transferred from one Member State to another, the supplier Member State shall record the product delivered as a zero entry in the accounts and the Member State of destination shall record it as a receipt in the month of dispatch, using the price calculated in accordance with paragraph 1.";
3. Article 8 is hereby repealed.
Article 2
This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
Commission Regulation (EC) No 1947/2002
of 31 October 2002
amending Regulation (EC) No 3223/94 on detailed rules for application of the import arrangements for fruit and vegetables
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 of 28 October 1996 on the common organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 545/2002(2), and in particular Article 32(5) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) The Belgian and Italian authorities have informed the Commission that Antwerp and Bologna are no longer representative import markets for fruit and vegetables. They should therefore be withdrawn from the list in Article 3(1) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 3223/94(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 453/2002(4).
(2) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for fresh Fruit and Vegetables,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:

2. The eighth indent is replaced by:
"- Italian Republic: Milan,"
Article 2
This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
Regulation (EC) No 2099/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council
of 5 November 2002
establishing a Committee on Safe Seas and the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (COSS) and amending the Regulations on maritime safety and the prevention of pollution from ships
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 80(2) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee(2),
Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions(3),
Acting in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 251 of the Treaty(4),
Whereas:
(1) The measures implementing the existing Regulations and Directives in the field of maritime safety were adopted by a regulatory procedure involving the Committee set up by Council Directive 93/75/EEC of 13 September 1993 concerning minimum requirements for vessels bound for or leaving Community ports and carrying dangerous or polluting goods(5) and, in certain cases, an ad hoc committee. These committees were governed by the rules set out in Council Decision 87/373/EEC of 13 July 1987 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(6).
(2) By its Resolution of 8 June 1993 on a common policy on safe seas(7), the Council approved in principle the establishment of a Committee on Safe Seas and the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (COSS) and called on the Commission to present a proposal to set up such a committee.
(3) The role of COSS is to centralise the tasks of the committees set up under the Community legislation on maritime safety, the prevention of pollution from ships and the protection of shipboard living and working conditions and to assist and advise the Commission on all matters of maritime safety and prevention or reduction of pollution of the environment by shipping activities.
(4) In keeping with the Resolution of 8 June 1993, a Committee on Safe Seas and the Prevention of Pollution from Ships should be set up and assigned the tasks previously devolved to the committees established under the aforesaid legislation. All new Community legislation adopted in the field of maritime safety should stipulate recourse to the Committee thereby set up.
(5) Decision 87/373/EEC has been replaced by Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(8), the provisions of which should therefore be applied to COSS. The purpose of the latter decision is to define the Committee procedures applicable and ensure more comprehensive information to the European Parliament and the public on the work of the committees.
(6) The measures required to implement the aforesaid legislation should be adopted in accordance with Decision 1999/468/EC.
(7) The aforesaid legislation should also be amended to substitute COSS for the Committee set up by Directive 93/75/EEC or, where appropriate, for the ad hoc committee established under any particular act. This Regulation should in particular amend the relevant provisions of Council Regulations (EEC) No 613/91 of 4 March 1991 on the transfer of ships from one register to another within the Community(9), (EC) No 2978/94 of 21 November 1994 on the implementation of IMO Resolution A.747(18) on the application of tonnage measurement of ballast spaces in segregated ballast oil tankers(10), (EC) No 3051/95 of 8 December 1995 on the safety management of roll-on/roll-off passenger ferries (ro-ro ferries)(11) and Regulation (EC) No 417/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 February 2002 on the accelerated phasing-in of double hull or equivalent design requirements for single hull oil tankers and repealing Council Regulation (EC) No 2978/94(12), in order to insert a reference to COSS and to stipulate the regulatory procedure laid down in Article 5 of Decision 1999/468/EC.
(8) Moreover, the aforesaid legislation is based on the application of rules resulting from international instruments in force at the date of adoption of the Community act in question, or at the date specified by the latter. As a consequence, Member States cannot apply the subsequent amendments to these international instruments until the Community Directives or Regulations have been amended. This has major disadvantages owing to the difficulty of ensuring that the date of entry into force of the amendment at international level coincides with that of the Regulation integrating this amendment into Community law, not least the delayed application within the Community of the most recent and most stringent international safety standards.
(9) However, it is necessary to draw a distinction between the provisions of a Community act making reference, for the purposes of their application, to an international instrument and Community provisions reproducing an international instrument in full or in part. In the latter case, the most recent amendments to the international instruments cannot in any case be rendered applicable until the Community provisions concerned have been amended.
(10) Member States should therefore be permitted to apply the most recent provisions of international instruments, with the exception of those explicitly incorporated in a Community act. This can be done by stating that the international convention applicable for the purposes of the Directive or Regulation concerned is that "in its up-to-date version", without mentioning the date.
(11) For reasons of transparency, the relevant amendments to international instruments that are integrated in Community maritime legislation should be made public in the Community through their publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
(12) A specific conformity checking procedure should, however, be set up to enable the Commission, after consulting COSS, to take whatever measures may be necessary to exclude the risk of amendments to the international instruments being incompatible with the aforesaid legislation or Community policy on maritime safety, the prevention of pollution from ships and the protection of shipboard living and working conditions in force or with the objectives pursued by that legislation. Such a procedure should also prevent international amendments from lowering the standard of maritime safety achieved in the Community.
(13) The conformity checking procedure will only be fully effective if the planned measures are adopted as speedily as possible, but at all events before the expiry of the deadline for the entry into force of the international amendment. Consequently, the time available to the Council to act on the proposed measures in accordance with Article 5(6) of Decision 1999/468/EC should be one month,
HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1

The purpose of this Regulation is to improve the implementation of the Community legislation referred to in Article 2(2) on maritime safety, the prevention of pollution from ships and shipboard living and working conditions:

2. A conformity checking procedure is hereby established in order to exclude from the scope of the Community maritime legislation any amendment to an international instrument only if, on the basis of an evaluation by the Commission, there is a manifest risk that the international amendment, within the scope of the Regulations or the Directives referred to in Article 2(2), will lower the standard of maritime safety, of prevention of pollution from ships or of protection of shipboard living and working conditions established by Community maritime legislation, or be incompatible with the latter.

Commission Decision
of 23 December 2002
implementing Council Regulation (EEC) No 1612/68 as regards the clearance of vacancies and applications for employment
(Text with EEA relevance)
(2003/8/EC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1612/68 of 15 October 1968 on freedom of movement for workers within the Community(1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2434/92(2), and in particular Article 44 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Much progress has been made since the initial launch of the European Employment Services network (EURES) established by Commission Decision 93/569/EEC(3), in order to implement Council Regulation (EEC) No 1612/68.
(2) In the light of the experience gained since 1993, and taking into account and consolidating recent developments in the EURES environment, the network should now be reinforced and fully integrated into the activities of employment services of the Member States. The current division of responsibilities and the decision-making procedures should be redesigned.
(3) With a view to the forthcoming enlargement of the European Union, full account should be taken of the implementation of EURES in the acceding countries while ensuring that the system remains efficient and manageable.
(4) The opportunities afforded by the emerging information and communication technology tools for further enhancing and rationalising the services provided should also be taken into account.
(5) To this end, EURES should be consolidated and strengthened as a key tool for the monitoring of mobility, for the support of the free movement of workers and the integration of the European labour markets, and for informing citizens about the relevant Community legislation.
(6) There is a need to underpin occupational and geographic mobility in line with the European Employment Strategy, in the interests of implementing the Action Plan for skills and mobility(4) and the Council Resolution of 3 June 2002 on the same issue(5).
(7) For the sake of clarity, it is advisable to re-establish the European Employment Services network whilst defining more precisely its composition, constitution and functions. This operation will entail the replacement of Decision 93/569/EEC.
(8) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Technical Committee on freedom of movement for workers,

Addressees
This Decision is addressed to the Member States.
Directive 2003/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council
of 14 April 2003
amending Council Directive 98/18/EC on safety rules and standards for passenger ships
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 80(2) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee(2),
Having consulted the Committee of the Regions,
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty(3),
Whereas:
(1) Council Directive 98/18/EC of 17 March 1998 on safety rules and standards for passenger ships(4) introduces a uniform level of safety of life and property on new and existing passenger ships and high-speed passenger craft, when both categories of ships and craft are engaged on domestic voyages, and lays down procedures for negotiation at international level with a view to a harmonisation of the rules for passenger ships engaged on international voyages.
(2) The definition of sea areas is crucial to determine the application of Directive 98/18/EC to different classes of passenger ships. The Directive includes a procedure for the publication of lists of sea areas that has proved difficult to implement. It is therefore necessary to establish a functional and transparent procedure, enabling effective monitoring of the implementation of the Directive.
(3) With a view to harmonising the level of safety applying to passenger ships across the Community, the derogation given to Greece in relation to the timetable for the application of the safety requirements should be deleted.
(4) Directive 2003/25/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 April 2003 on specific stability requirements for ro-ro passenger ships(5) introduces strengthened stability requirements for ro-ro passenger vessels operating on international services to and from Community ports, and this enhanced measure should also apply to certain categories of such vessels operating on domestic services under the same sea conditions. Failure to apply such stability requirements should be grounds for phasing out ro-ro passenger ships after a certain number of years of operation.
(5) In view of the structural modifications that the existing ro-ro passenger ships may need to undergo in order to comply with the specific stability requirements, those requirements should be introduced over a period of years in order to allow to the part of the industry affected sufficient time to comply: to that end, a phasing-in timetable for existing ships should be provided. This phasing-in timetable should not affect the enforcement of the specific stability requirements in the sea areas covered by the Annexes to the Stockholm Agreement of 28 February 1996.
(6) It is necessary to take account of changes that have been made to relevant international instruments, such as the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) conventions, protocols, codes and resolutions, and to do so in a flexible and rapid manner.
(7) By virtue of Directive 98/18/EC, the International Code for Safety of High-Speed Craft contained in IMO Maritime Safety Committee Resolution MSC 36 (63) of 20 May 1994 applies to all high-speed passenger craft operating on domestic services. The IMO has adopted a new high-speed craft code, the International Code for Safety of High-Speed Craft, 2000 (2000 HSC Code), contained in IMO Maritime Safety Committee Resolution MSC 97(73) of 5 December 2000, applying to all high-speed craft constructed on or after 1 July 2002. It is important to ensure that Directive 98/18/EC can be updated in a flexible manner to apply such developments at the international level, also to high-speed passenger craft operating on domestic services.
(8) It is important to apply appropriate measures to ensure the access in safe conditions of persons with reduced mobility to ships and high-speed passenger craft operating on domestic services in the Member States.
(9) Directive 98/18/EC should therefore be amended accordingly,
HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:
Article 1
Directive 98/18/EC is hereby amended as follows:
1. in Article 2 the following points shall be added:
"(ea) 'ro-ro passenger ship' means a ship carrying more than 12 passengers, having ro-ro cargo spaces or special category spaces, as defined in regulation II-2/A/2 contained in Annex I."
"(ha) 'age' means the age of the ship, expressed in number of years after the date of its delivery."
"(w) 'persons with reduced mobility' means anyone who has a particular difficulty when using public transport, including elderly persons, disabled persons, persons with sensory impairments and wheelchair users, pregnant women and persons accompanying small children.";
2. Article 4(2) shall be replaced by the following:
"2. Each Member State shall:
(a) establish, and update, when necessary, a list of sea areas under its jurisdiction, delimiting the zones for all-year-round operation and, where appropriate, restricted periodical operation of the classes of ships, using the criteria for classes set out in paragraph 1;
(b) publish the list in a public database available on the Internet site of the competent maritime authority;
(c) notify to the Commission the location of such information, and when modifications are made to the list.";
3. the following Articles shall be inserted:
"Article 6a
Stability requirements and phasing-out of ro-ro passenger ships
1. All ro-ro passenger ships of Classes A, B, and C, the keel of which is laid or which are at a similar stage of construction on or after 1 October 2004 shall comply with Articles 6, 8 and 9 of Directive 2003/25/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 April 2003 on specific stability requirements for ro-ro passenger ships(6).
2. All ro-ro passenger ships of Classes A and B, the keel of which is laid or which are at a similar stage of construction before 1 October 2004 shall comply with Articles 6, 8 and 9 of Directive 2003/25/EC by 1 October 2010, unless they are phased out on that date or on a later date on which they reach the age of 30 years but in any case not later than 1 October 2015.
Article 6b
Safety requirements for persons with reduced mobility
1. Member States shall ensure that appropriate measures are taken, based, where practicable, on the guidelines in Annex III to enable persons with reduced mobility to have safe access to all passenger ships of Classes A, B, C and D and to all high-speed passenger craft, used for public transport, the keel of which is laid or which are at a similar stage of construction on or after 1 October 2004.
2. Member States shall cooperate with and consult organisations representing persons with reduced mobility on the implementation of the guidelines included in Annex III.
3. For the purpose of modification of passenger ships of Classes A, B, C and D and high-speed passenger craft, used for public transport, the keel of which is laid or which are at a similar stage of construction before 1 October 2004, Member States shall apply the guidelines in Annex III as far as reasonable and practicable in economic terms.
Member States shall draw up a national action plan on how the guidelines shall be applied to such ships and craft. They shall forward that plan to the Commission not later than 17 May 2005.
4. Member States shall report to the Commission on the implementation of this Article as regards all passenger ships referred to in paragraph 1, passenger ships referred to in paragraph 3 certified to carry more than 400 passengers and all high-speed passenger craft, not later than 17 May 2006."
4. Annex III shall be added, as set out in the Annex.
Article 2
Article 6(3)(g) of Directive 98/18/EC shall be deleted with effect from 1 January 2005.
Article 3
Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive before 17 November 2004. They shall forthwith inform the Commission thereof.
When Member States adopt these measures, they shall contain a reference to this Directive or shall be accompanied by such a reference on the occasion of their official publication. The methods of making such a reference shall be laid down by the Member States.
Article 4
Commission Directive 2003/26/EC
of 3 April 2003
adapting to technical progress Directive 2000/30/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards speed limiters and exhaust emissions of commercial vehicles
(Text with EEA relevance)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Directive 2000/30/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 June 2000 on the technical roadside inspection of the roadworthiness of commercial vehicles circulating in the Community(1), and in particular Article 8 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Directive 2000/30/EC concerns a legal framework for the roadside inspection of commercial vehicles, whether carrying passengers or freight. It requires Member States to supplement the annual roadworthiness test with unexpected inspections of a representative proportion of the commercial vehicle fleet on their roads each year.
(2) The field of roadworthiness testing is embraced by Council Directive 96/96/EC of 20 December 1996 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to roadworthiness tests for motor vehicles and their trailers(2), as last amended by Commission Directive 2001/11/EC(3), which covers regular roadworthiness testing, and by Directive 2000/30/EC, which applies to the roadside inspections of heavy commercial vehicles for their roadworthiness. Both Directives use the same Committee and the same procedure for technical adaptations.
(3) Directive 96/96/EC has been amended by the prescription of stricter emission limits for certain categories of motor vehicle and the functional testing of speed limitation devices on heavy commercial vehicles. In order to be consistent with that Directive, Directive 2000/30/EC also needs to be adapted so as to include the new technical provisions, namely by bringing on-board diagnostic (OBD) monitoring systems and speed limiters within the scope of roadside inspections. Directive 2000/30/EC also needs updating (together with Directive 96/96/EC) to incorporate revised emission testing limit values for certain categories of motor vehicles.
(4) The provisions of this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee on the adaptation to Technical Progress set up pursuant to Article 8 of Directive 96/96/EC,
HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:
Article 1
Annexes I and II to Directive 2000/30/EC are amended as set out in the Annex to this Directive.
Article 2
1. Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by 1 January 2004 at the latest. They shall forthwith inform the Commission thereof.
When Member States adopt those provisions, they shall contain a reference to this Directive or be accompanied by such a reference on the occasion of their official publication. Member States shall determine how such reference is to be made.
2. Member States shall communicate to the Commission the texts of the provisions of national law that they adopt in the field governed by this Directive.
Article 3
Directive 2003/30/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council
of 8 May 2003
on the promotion of the use of biofuels or other renewable fuels for transport
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 175(1) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee(2),
Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions(3),
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty(4),
Whereas:
(1) The European Council meeting at Gothenburg on 15 and 16 June 2001 agreed on a Community strategy for sustainable development consisting in a set of measures, which include the development of biofuels.
(2) Natural resources, and their prudent and rational utilisation as referred to in Article 174(1) of the Treaty, include oil, natural gas and solid fuels, which are essential sources of energy but also the leading sources of carbon dioxide emissions.
(3) However, there is a wide range of biomass that could be used to produce biofuels, deriving from agricultural and forestry products, as well as from residues and waste from forestry and the forestry and agrifoodstuffs industry.
(4) The transport sector accounts for more than 30 % of final energy consumption in the Community and is expanding, a trend which is bound to increase, along with carbon dioxide emissions and this expansion will be greater in percentage terms in the candidate countries following their accession to the European Union.
(5) The Commission White Paper "European transport policy for 2010: time to decide" expects CO2 emissions from transport to rise by 50 % between 1990 and 2010, to around 1113 million tonnes, the main responsibility resting with road transport, which accounts for 84 % of transport-related CO2 emissions. From an ecological point of view, the White Paper therefore calls for dependence on oil (currently 98 %) in the transport sector to be reduced by using alternative fuels such as biofuels.
(6) Greater use of biofuels for transport forms a part of the package of measures needed to comply with the Kyoto Protocol, and of any policy package to meet further commitments in this respect.
(7) Increased use of biofuels for transport, without ruling out other possible alternative fuels, including automotive LPG and CNG, is one of the tools by which the Community can reduce its dependence on imported energy and influence the fuel market for transport and hence the security of energy supply in the medium and long term. However, this consideration should not detract in any way from the importance of compliance with Community legislation on fuel quality, vehicle emissions and air quality.
(8) As a result of technological advances, most vehicles currently in circulation in the European Union are capable of using a low biofuel blend without any problem. The most recent technological developments make it possible to use higher percentages of biofuel in the blend. Some countries are already using biofuel blends of 10 % and higher.
(9) Captive fleets offer the potential of using a higher concentration of biofuels. In some cities captive fleets are already operating on pure biofuels and, in some cases, this has helped to improve air quality in urban areas. Member States could therefore further promote the use of biofuels in public transport modes.
(10) Promoting the use of biofuels in transport constitutes a step towards a wider application of biomass which will enable biofuel to be more extensively developed in the future, whilst not excluding other options and, in particular, the hydrogen option.
(11) The research policy pursued by the Member States relating to increased use of biofuels should incorporate the hydrogen sector to a significant degree and promote this option, taking into account the relevant Community framework programmes.
(12) Pure vegetable oil from oil plants produced through pressing, extraction or comparable procedures, crude or refined but chemically unmodified, can also be used as biofuel in specific cases where its use is compatible with the type of engines involved and the corresponding emission requirements.
(13) New types of fuel should conform to recognised technical standards if they are to be accepted to a greater extent by customers and vehicle manufacturers and hence penetrate the market. Technical standards also form the basis for requirements concerning emissions and the monitoring of emissions. Difficulties may be encountered in ensuring that new types of fuel meet current technical standards, which, to a large extent, have been developed for conventional fossil fuels. The Commission and standardisation bodies should monitor developments and adapt and develop actively standards, particularly volatility aspects, so that new types of fuel can be introduced, whilst maintaining environmental performance requirements.
(14) Bioethanol and biodiesel, when used for vehicles in pure form or as a blend, should comply with the quality standards laid down to ensure optimum engine performance. It is noted that in the case of biodiesel for diesel engines, where the processing option is esterification, the standard prEN 14214 of the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) on fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) could be applied. Accordingly, the CEN should establish appropriate standards for other transport biofuel products in the European Union.
(15) Promoting the use of biofuels in keeping with sustainable farming and forestry practices laid down in the rules governing the common agricultural policy could create new opportunities for sustainable rural development in a more market-orientated common agriculture policy geared more to the European market and to respect for flourishing country life and multifunctional agriculture, and could open a new market for innovative agricultural products with regard to present and future Member States.
(16) In its resolution of 8 June 1998(5), the Council endorsed the Commission's strategy and action plan for renewable energy sources and requested specific measures in the biofuels sector.
(17) The Commission Green Paper "Towards a European strategy for the security of energy supply" sets the objective of 20 % substitution of conventional fuels by alternative fuels in the road transport sector by the year 2020.
(18) Alternative fuels will only be able to achieve market penetration if they are widely available and competitive.
(19) In its resolution of 18 June 1998(6), the European Parliament called for an increase in the market share of biofuels to 2 % over five years through a package of measures, including tax exemption, financial assistance for the processing industry and the establishment of a compulsory rate of biofuels for oil companies.
(20) The optimum method for increasing the share of biofuels in the national and Community markets depends on the availability of resources and raw materials, on national and Community policies to promote biofuels and on tax arrangements, and on the appropriate involvement of all stakeholders/parties.
(21) National policies to promote the use of biofuels should not lead to prohibition of the free movement of fuels that meet the harmonised environmental specifications as laid down in Community legislation.
(22) Promotion of the production and use of biofuels could contribute to a reduction in energy import dependency and in emissions of greenhouse gases. In addition, biofuels, in pure form or as a blend, may in principle be used in existing motor vehicles and use the current motor vehicle fuel distribution system. The blending of biofuel with fossil fuels could facilitate a potential cost reduction in the distribution system in the Community.
(23) Since the objective of the proposed action, namely the introduction of general principles providing for a minimum percentage of biofuels to be marketed and distributed, cannot be achieved sufficiently by the Member States by reason of the scale of the action, and can therefore be achieved better at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.
(24) Research and technological development in the field of the sustainability of biofuels should be promoted.
(25) An increase in the use of biofuels should be accompanied by a detailed analysis of the environmental, economic and social impact in order to decide whether it is advisable to increase the proportion of biofuels in relation to conventional fuels.
(26) Provision should be made for the possibility of adapting rapidly the list of biofuels, the percentage of renewable contents, and the schedule for introducing biofuels in the transport fuel market, to technical progress and to the results of an environmental impact assessment of the first phase of introduction.
(27) Measures should be introduced for developing rapidly the quality standards for the biofuels to be used in the automotive sector, both as pure biofuels and as a blending component in the conventional fuels. Although the biodegradable fraction of waste is a potentially useful source for producing biofuels, the quality standard has to take into account the possible contamination present in the waste to avoid special components damaging the vehicle or causing emissions to deteriorate.
(28) Encouragement of the promotion of biofuels should be consistent with security of supply and environmental objectives and related policy objectives and measures within each Member State. In doing so, Member States may consider cost-effective ways of publicising the possibilities of using biofuels.
(29) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Directive should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(7),
HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:

(b) as biofuels blended in mineral oil derivatives, in accordance with the appropriate European norms describing the technical specifications for transport fuels (EN 228 and EN 590);
(c) as liquids derived from biofuels, such as ETBE (ethyl-tertio-butyl-ether), where the percentage of biofuel is as specified in Article 2(2).
3. Member States shall monitor the effect of the use of biofuels in diesel blends above 5 % by non-adapted vehicles and shall, where appropriate, take measures to ensure compliance with the relevant Community legislation on emission standards.
4. In the measures that they take, the Member States should consider the overall climate and environmental balance of the various types of biofuels and other renewable fuels and may give priority to the promotion of those fuels showing a very good cost-effective environmental balance, while also taking into account competitiveness and security of supply.
5. Member States shall ensure that information is given to the public on the availability of biofuels and other renewable fuels. For percentages of biofuels, blended in mineral oil derivatives, exceeding the limit value of 5 % of fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) or of 5 % of bioethanol, a specific labelling at the sales points shall be imposed.
Article 4
1. Member States shall report to the Commission, before 1 July each year, on:
- the measures taken to promote the use of biofuels or other renewable fuels to replace diesel or petrol for transport purposes,
- the national resources allocated to the production of biomass for energy uses other than transport, and
- the total sales of transport fuel and the share of biofuels, pure or blended, and other renewable fuels placed on the market for the preceding year. Where appropriate, Member States shall report on any exceptional conditions in the supply of crude oil or oil products that have affected the marketing of biofuels and other renewable fuels.
In their first report following the entry into force of this Directive, Member States shall indicate the level of their national indicative targets for the first phase. In the report covering the year 2006, Member States shall indicate their national indicative targets for the second phase.
In these reports, differentiation of the national targets, as compared to the reference values referred to in Article 3(1)(b), shall be motivated and could be based on the following elements:
(a) objective factors such as the limited national potential for production of biofuels from biomass;
(b) the amount of resources allocated to the production of biomass for energy uses other than transport and the specific technical or climatic characteristics of the national market for transport fuels;
(c) national policies allocating comparable resources to the production of other transport fuels based on renewable energy sources and consistent with the objectives of this Directive.
2. By 31 December 2006 at the latest, and every two years thereafter, the Commission shall draw up an evaluation report for the European Parliament and for the Council on the progress made in the use of biofuels and other renewable fuels in the Member States.
This report shall cover at least the following:
(a) the cost-effectiveness of the measures taken by Member States in order to promote the use of biofuels and other renewable fuels;
(b) the economic aspects and the environmental impact of further increasing the share of biofuels and other renewable fuels;
(c) the life-cycle perspective of biofuels and other renewable fuels, with a view to indicating possible measures for the future promotion of those fuels that are climate and environmentally friendly, and that have the potential of becoming competitive and cost-efficient;
(d) the sustainability of crops used for the production of biofuels, particularly land use, degree of intensity of cultivation, crop rotation and use of pesticides;
(e) the assessment of the use of biofuels and other renewable fuels with respect to their differentiating effects on climate change and their impact on CO2 emissions reduction;
(f) a review of further more long-term options concerning energy efficiency measures in transport.
On the basis of this report, the Commission shall submit, where appropriate, proposals to the European Parliament and to the Council on the adaptation of the system of targets, as laid down in Article 3(1). If this report concludes that the indicative targets are not likely to be achieved for reasons that are unjustified and/or do not relate to new scientific evidence, these proposals shall address national targets, including possible mandatory targets, in the appropriate form.
Article 5
The list contained in Article 2(2) may be adapted to technical progress in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 6(2). When adapting this list, the environmental impact of biofuels shall be taken into account.

Commission Directive 2003/60/EC
of 18 June 2003
amending the Annexes to Council Directives 76/895/EEC, 86/362/EEC, 86/363/EEC and 90/642/EEC as regards the fixing of maximum levels for certain pesticide residues in and on cereals, foodstuffs of animal origin and certain products of plant origin, including fruit and vegetables
(Text with EEA relevance)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 76/895/EEC of 23 November 1976 relating to the fixing of maximum levels for pesticide residues in and on fruit and vegetables(1), as last amended by Commission Directive 2002/79/EC(2), and in particular Article 5 thereof,
Having regard to Council Directive 86/362/EEC of 24 July 1986 on the fixing of maximum levels for pesticide residues in and on cereals(3), as last amended by Directive 2002/79/EC, and in particular Article 10 thereof,
Having regard to Council Directive 86/363/EEC of 24 July 1986 on the fixing of maximum levels for pesticide residues in and on foodstuffs of animal origin(4), as last amended by Directive 2002/79/EC, and in particular Article 10 thereof,
Having regard to Council Directive 90/642/EEC of 27 November 1990 on fixing of maximum levels for pesticide residues in and on certain products of plant origin including fruit and vegetables(5), as last amended by Commission Directive 2002/100/EC(6), and in particular Article 7 thereof,
Having regard to Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market(7), as last amended by Commission Directive 2003/39/EC(8), and in particular Article 4(1)(f) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) The existing active substances amitrole, diquat, isoproturon and ethofumesate, were included in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC by Commission Directives 2001/21/EC(9), 2002/18/EC(10) and 2002/37/EC(11), respectively.
(2) The new active substances fenhexamid, acibenzolar-S-methyl, cyclanilide, pyraflufen-ethyl, iprovalicarb, prosulfuron, sulfosulfuron, cinidon-ethyl, cyhalofop butyl, famoxadone, florasulam, metalaxyl-M, picolinafen and flumioxazine were included in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC by Commission Directives 2001/28/EC(12), 2001/87/EC(13), 2002/48/EC(14), 2002/64/EC(15) and 2002/81/EC(16).
(3) The inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC of the active substances concerned was based on the assessment of the information submitted concerning the proposed use. Information relating to this use has been submitted by certain Member States in accordance with Article 4(1)(f) of Directive 91/414/EEC. The information available has been reviewed and is sufficient to allow certain maximum residue levels (MRLs) to be fixed.
(4) Where no Community MRL or provisional MRL exists, Member States are to establish a national provisional MRL in accordance with Article 4(1)(f) of Directive 91/414/EEC before plant protection products containing these active substances may be authorised.
(5) For the active substances chlorfenapyr, fentin acetate and fentin hydroxide decisions were taken not to include them in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC by Commission Decision 2001/697/EC(17), 2002/478/EC(18) and 2002/479/EC(19), respectively. These Decisions provided that plant protection products containing these active substances shall no longer be authorised for use in the Community. It is therefore necessary to add all of the pesticide residues arising from use of these plant protection products to the Annexes to Directives 86/362/EEC, 86/363/EEC and 90/642/EEC to allow for proper surveillance and control of the prohibition of their uses and to protect the consumer.
(6) In order to allow legitimate expectations to be fulfilled for existing stocks of pesticides to be used, the Commission non-inclusion Decisions allowed a phasing-out period, and it is appropriate that MRLs premised on the notion that use of the substance concerned is not authorised in the Community, should not apply until the end of the phasing-out period applying to that substance.
(7) Community MRLs and the levels recommended by the Codex Alimentarius are fixed and evaluated following similar procedures. There are a limited number of Codex MRLs for diquat and fentin (-acetate or -hydroxide). These have been considered in the setting of the MRLs fixed in this Directive. Codex MRLs that will be recommended for withdrawal in the near future were not taken into account. The MRLs based on Codex MRLs having been evaluated in the light of the risks for the consumers, no risk was established when using the toxicological end points based on the studies available to the Commission.
(8) With respect to the inclusion in or exclusion from Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC of the active substances concerned, the related technical and scientific evaluations were finalised in the form of Commission review reports. The assessment reports for the substances mentioned were finalised on the dates as mentioned in the Commission Directives cited under (1) and (2) and in the Commission Decisions cited under (5). These reports fixed the acceptable daily intake (ADI) and, if necessary, the acute reference dose (ARfD) for the substances concerned. The lifetime exposure of consumers to food products treated with the active substance concerned has been assessed and evaluated in accordance with Community procedures. Account has also been taken of guidelines published by the World Health Organisation(20) and the opinion of the Scientific Committee for Plants(21) on the methodology employed. It is concluded that MRLs proposed will not lead to those ADIs or ARfD being exceeded.
(9) In order to ensure that the consumer is adequately protected from exposure to residues resulting from unauthorised uses of plant protection products, provisional MRLs should be set for the relevant product/pesticide combinations at the lower limit of analytical determination.
(10) The setting at Community level of such provisional MRLs does not prevent the Member States from establishing provisional MRLs for the substances in this Directive in accordance with Article 4(1)(f) of Directive 91/414/EEC and Annex VI thereto. It is considered that a period of four years is sufficient to permit further uses of the active substance concerned. The provisional MRL should then become definitive.
(11) It is therefore necessary to add all of the pesticide residues arising from use of these plant protection products to the Annexes to Directives 86/362/EEC, 86/363/EEC and 90/642/EEC to allow for proper surveillance and control of the prohibition of their uses and to protect the consumer. The Annexes to Directives 86/362/EEC, 86/363/EEC and 90/642/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.
(12) To establish maximum levels of pesticide residues for diquat at Community level it is necessary to transfer provisions from Directive 76/895/EEC to Directives 86/362/EEC, 86/363/EEC and 90/642/EEC, delete these provisions in Directive 76/895/EEC and amend some of these provisions in the light of technical and scientific progress as well as changes in uses and authorisations at national and Community level.
(13) This Directive is in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,
HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:
Article 1
In Annex II to Directive 76/895/EEC the entries relating to diquat shall be deleted.
Article 2
The maximum pesticide residue levels as shown in Annex I to this Directive are added to Part A of Annex II to Directive 86/362/EEC:
Article 3
The maximum pesticide residue levels as shown in Annex II and III to this Directive are added to Annex II A and B to Directive 86/363/EEC.
Article 4
The maximum pesticide residue levels as shown in Annex IV to this Directive are added to Annex II to Directive 90/642/EEC.
Article 5
Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by 30 June 2003 at the latest except for the provisions for fentin hydroxide, fentin acetate and chlorfenapyr, which shall be brought into force by 30 June 2004. They shall forthwith inform the Commission thereof.
They shall apply these provisions with effect from 1 July 2003, except for the provisions for fentin hydroxide, fentin acetate and chlorfenapyr, which they shall apply by 1 July 2004.
When Member States adopt those provisions, they shall contain a reference to this Directive or be accompanied by such a reference on the occasion of their official publication. Member States shall determine how such reference is to be made.
Article 6
This Directive shall enter into force on the 20th day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.
Article 7
This Directive is addressed to the Member States.

Commission Regulation (EC) No 1053/2003
of 19 June 2003
amending Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards rapid tests
(Text with EEA relevance)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 laying down rules for the prevention, control and eradication of certain transmissible spongiform encephalopathies(1), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 260/2003(2), and in particular the first subparagraph of Article 23 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 sets out a list of national reference laboratories for TSEs for the purposes of that Regulation. Greece has changed its national reference laboratory.
(2) Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 also sets out a list of rapid tests approved for TSE monitoring.
(3) The company marketing one of the rapid tests approved for TSE monitoring has informed the Commission of its intention to market the test under a new trade name.
(4) In its opinion of 6 and 7 March 2003, the Scientific Steering Committee recommended the inclusion of two new tests in the list of rapid tests approved for monitoring of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). The producers of both tests have provided data showing that their test may also be used for monitoring of TSE in sheep.
(5) In order to ensure that approved rapid tests maintain the same level of performance after approval a procedure should be laid down for possible modifications to the test or the test protocol.
(6) Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 should therefore be amended accordingly.
(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
Annex X to Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.
Article 2
This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.
Commission Regulation (EC) No 1139/2003
of 27 June 2003
amending Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards monitoring programmes and specified risk material
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 laying down rules for the prevention, control and eradication of certain transmissible spongiform encephalopathies(1), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1003/2003(2), and in particular Article 23 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 lays down rules for the monitoring of transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) in ovine and caprine animals, including monitoring of a sample of animals not slaughtered for human consumption. It is necessary to clarify the definition of this group of animals, in order to avoid the inappropriate targeting of samples.
(2) Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 provides for eradication measures following the confirmation of TSE in ovine and caprine animals. Targeted testing should be carried out on animals destroyed under these measures, in order to gather epidemiological information.
(3) There is a theoretical possibility that BSE may exist in the ovine and caprine population. It is not possible using routine methods to distinguish between BSE and scrapie infection in these animals. The level of infectivity in the ileum in both diseases is significant from an early stage of infection. As a precautionary measure, the ileum of ovine and caprine animals of all ages should be added to the list of specified risk materials.
(4) In its opinion of 7 and 8 November 2002 on TSE infectivity distribution in ruminant tissues, the Scientific Steering Committee (SSC) recommended that tonsils of bovine animals of any age should be regarded as posing a risk of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE).
(5) The SSC has stated that contamination with central nervous tissue and tonsil material are to be avoided when harvesting head meat and tongues of bovine animals for human consumption, to avoid any risk of BSE.
(6) As the condition of heads depends mainly on their careful handling and a safe sealing of the frontal shot hole and the foramen magnum, control systems must be in place in the slaughterhouses and in the specifically authorised cutting plants.
(7) The rules to dispatch carcases, half carcases and quarter carcases containing no specified risk material other than vertebral column to other Member States without the latter's prior agreement should be expanded to half carcases cut into no more than three wholesale cuts reflecting the actual trade between Member States.
(8) Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council(3), amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 808/2003(4), lays down animal and public health rules for the collection, transport, storage, handling, processing and use or disposal of all animal by-products not intended for human consumption, including their placing on the market and, in certain specific cases, their export and transit. Special rules on removal and disposal of such products provided for in Annex XI to Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 should therefore be deleted.
(9) Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 should therefore be amended accordingly.
(10) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
Annexes III and XI to Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 are amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.
Article 2
This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
Regulation (EC) No 1267/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council
of 16 June 2003
amending Council Regulation (EC) No 2223/96 with respect to the time limit for transmission of the main aggregates of national accounts, to the derogations concerning the transmission of the main aggregates of national accounts and to the transmission of employment data in hours worked
(Text with EEA relevance)
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 285 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Central Bank(2),
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty(3),
Whereas:
(1) Council Regulation (EC) No 2223/96 of 25 June 1996 on the European system of national and regional accounts in the Community(4) contains the reference framework of common standards, definitions, classifications and accounting rules for drawing up the accounts of the Member States for the statistical requirements of the Community, in order to obtain comparable results between Member States.
(2) The report of the Monetary Committee on statistical requirements in the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), endorsed by the Ecofin Council of 18 January 1999, underlined that, for the proper functioning of the EMU and the single market, effective surveillance and coordination of economic policies are of major importance and that this requires a comprehensive statistical information system providing policy makers with the necessary data on which to base their decisions. This report outlined the high priority in having such information available for the Community and especially for Member States participating in the euro area.
(3) The report underlined that the cross-country comparison of the labour market will demand more attention in the EMU.
(4) In order to compile quarterly statistics for the euro area, the time limit for transmission of the main aggregates of national accounts should be reduced to 70 days.
(5) Quarterly and annual derogations accorded to Member States that prevent the compilation of the main aggregates of national accounts for the euro area and the Community should be abrogated.
(6) The Action Plan on Economic and Monetary Union Statistical Requirements, endorsed by the Ecofin Council of 29 September 2000, identifies as a priority the transmission of national accounts employment data according to the unit "hours worked".
(7) The Statistical Programme Committee (SPC) and the Committee on Monetary, Financial and Balance of Payments Statistics (CMFB) have been consulted in accordance with Article 3 of Council Decision 89/382/EEC, Euratom(5), and Council Decision 91/115/EEC(6), respectively,

of 30 October 2003
amending Regulation (EC) No 1488/2001 laying down rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 3448/93 as regards the placement of certain quantities of certain basic products listed in Annex I to the Treaty establishing the European Community under the inward processing arrangements without prior examination of the economic conditions
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 3448/93 of 6 December 1993 laying down the trade arrangements applicable to certain goods resulting from the processing of agricultural products(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2580/2000(2), and in particular the third subparagraph of Article 11(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 11(1) of Regulation (EC) No 3448/93 provides that the economic conditions set out in Article 117(c) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 of 12 October 1992 establishing the Community Customs Code(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2700/2000 of the European Parliament and of the Council(4), are to be considered fulfilled for the admission of certain quantities of certain basic products under the inward processing arrangements for use in the manufacture of goods. The detailed rules for application of that provision, making it possible to determine the basic agricultural products to be admitted under inward processing arrangements and check and plan the quantities thereof, are to be adopted in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EC) No 3448/93.
(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1488/2001(5), should be amended to clarify that, for determining the basic agricultural products to be admitted under inward processing arrangements and for checking and planning the quantities thereof, the procedures set out in Article 16 of Regulation (EC) No 3448/93 are applicable.
(3) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee on horizontal questions concerning trade in processed agricultural products not listed in Annex I to the Treaty,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
Regulation (EC) No 1488/2001 is amended as follows:
1. Article 2(2) is replaced by the following:
"2. If the estimated amount needed for refunds exceeds the funds available, the quantities of the various products, as identified by their eight-digit Combined Nomenclature code, shall be determined, in accordance with Article 11(1) of Regulation (EC) No 3448/93, with the aid of the balance."
2. In Article 22, the second paragraph is replaced by the following:"Where the amount of refunds due is estimated to be greater than the financial resources available, and taking into account the quantities already granted with certificates and the unused quantities of which the Commission has been informed in accordance with Article 25 of this Regulation, the remaining quantity available for each basic product shall be determined in accordance with Article 11(1) of Regulation (EC) No 3448/93. That quantity shall be the subject of a second publication in the Official Journal of the European Union by no later than 31 January of each year and of a third publication by no later than 31 May of each year."

Emergency issue of IP certificates
Commission Regulation (EC) No 2151/2003
of 16 December 2003
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 2195/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 November 2002 on the Common Procurement Vocabulary (CPV)(1), and in particular Article 2 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 2195/2002 established a single classification system applicable to public procurement to standardise the references used by contracting authorities and entities to describe the subject matter of their contracts.
(2) The structure and codes of the CPV may need to be adapted or amended in the light of developments in the markets and users' needs.
(3) The structure and codes of the CPV should be updated to take account of specific needs expressed by Member States and by users of the CPV and to correct material errors that were detected in the various linguistic versions.
(4) Technical adjustments and improvements, which were identified during the legislative process leading to the adoption of Regulation (EC) No 2195/2002 but which could not be taken into account in that Regulation, should be introduced in the Annexes to that Regulation.
(5) In its opinion(2) on the proposal for a Regulation on the CPV the Committee of the Regions pointed out that the classification of medicines required improvement and recommended the use of the "Anatomic Therapeutic Chemical" (ATC) classification system drawn up by the World Health Organisation to complete the CPV structure and codes for medicinal products.
(6) Interested parties and CPV users made specific suggestions for improvements of the CPV.
(7) The update of the CPV codes and structure should be reflected in the illustrative tables showing the correspondence between the CPV and the Provisional Central Product Classification (CPC Prov.) of the United Nations, the General Industrial Classification of Economic Activities within the European Communities (NACE Rev. 1) and the Combined Nomenclature (CN).
(8) In the interest of clarity, the CPV should be replaced entirely as well as the correspondence table between the CPV and the CPC Prov. All amendments to the CPV codes or their descriptions should be listed in a separate new Annex to Regulation (EC) No 2195/2002.
(9) The entry into force of Commission Regulation (EC) No 204/2002 of 19 December 2001(3) amending Council Regulation (EEC) No 3696/93 on the statistical classification of products by activity (CPA) in the European Economic Community has rendered obsolete the information given in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 2195/2002, which shows the correspondence between the CPV and the CPA 96.
(10) In Common Position (EC) No 33/2003 of 20 March 2003 adopted by the Council with a view to adopting a directive of the European Parliament and the Council on the coordination of procedures for the award of public works contracts, public supply contracts and public service contracts(4) and Common Position (EC) No 34/2003 of 20 March 2003 adopted by the Council with a view to adopting a directive of the European Parliament and the Council coordinating the procurement procedures of entities operating in the water, energy, transport and postal services sectors(5), product areas are not established by means of reference to the statistical classification of products by activity (CPA).
(11) For those reasons, it is not appropriate to update the correspondence table between the CPV and the CPA 96 set out in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 2195/2002. That Annex should therefore be deleted.
(12) Regulation (EC) No 2195/2002 should therefore be amended accordingly.
(13) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Advisory Committee on Public Procurement,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
